Ⅱ. Overview of business
1.  Management policies, business environment and issues to be addressed
The IHI Group’s management policies, business environment, and issues to be addressed are as follows. Forward-looking 
statements in the text are based on the Group’s judgements as of the end of the current fiscal year (March 31, 2024).
(1) IHI’s basic policy for management
The IHI Group positions being a good corporate citizen who develops together with society as its primary objective. And, through 
the below visions based on its management philosophies of “Contribute to the development of society through technology” and 
“Human resources are our single most valuable asset,” the IHI Group promotes ESG management with the IHI Sustainability 
Goal of “Create a world where nature and technology work in unity.” The IHI Group aims to realize a sustainable society by 
resolving climate change issues through its business activities, driven by a corporate culture that respects human rights and 
encourages diversity and inclusion.
(2) Management strategy and management indicators
Based on its three-year medium-term management plan, the “Group Management Policies 2023,” which begins in fiscal year 
2023, the IHI Group will promote more concrete and full-fledged reform of its businesses to achieve sustainable high growth, and 
at the same time, it will accelerate its transformation into a corporate structure capable of responding to drastic changes in the 
business environment.
Initiatives and Management Objectives of the “Group Management Policies 2023”
ⅰ. Business transformation to achieve sustainable high growth
In order to solve social issues through its business and achieve sustainable high growth for both society and the IHI Group, it is 
important to provide value throughout the lifecycle of customers’ businesses and to enhance value by building a value chain. 
Under the “Group Management Policies 2023,” the business is separated into the following three categories, all of which will be 
approached with a strong awareness of lifecycles and value chains.
- Growth businesses: aero-engine and rocket fields
The IHI Group positioned the aero-engine and rocket fields as businesses that will drive the growth of the IHI 
Group.
The IHI Group aims to achieve sustainable growth by expanding its defense business in response to the 
government's policy of drastically strengthening defense capabilities, and by promoting the space business as a 
long-term growth driver, while building on the expansion of the Civil aero engines Business in response to 
increasing passenger demand. The IHI Group will also work to develop electrification and hydrogen propulsion 
technologies toward carbon neutrality and to create new businesses through synergy of technologies and 
experiences in the Civil aero engines Business and the Defense systems Business.
- Development businesses: clean energy field
The IHI Group will work to develop the clean energy field into a business that will be the twin of the aero-engine 
and rocket fields and a growth driver for the IHI Group.
The IHI Group is a world leader in ammonia combustion technologies, and going forward, it will strive to 
contribute to society and customers by building an ammonia value chain that includes storage and transportation. 
The IHI Group will also work to create new business models, such as investing in fuel production projects.
- Core businesses:
The IHI Group continued to position the Business Areas of Resources, Energy and Environment, Social 
Infrastructure, and Industrial Systems and General-Purpose Machinery as the core of the IHI Group.
These businesses will not be an extension of its existing businesses, however, will provide more advanced services 
to customers by getting deeper into their lifecycle and feeding back the knowledge the IHI Group gains from this 
process.
In addition, in order to generate management resources, such as cash and human resources, to be invested in

(3) Business environment and issues to be addressed
<Short-term management>
As announced on April 24, 2024, it was found that improper alterations had been made in the test operation records for marine 
engines and land-use engines manufactured by IHI’s subsidiary, IHI Power Systems Co.
In response to this matter, the IHI Group has established a special investigation committee consisting of outside experts, including 
lawyers, to investigate the cause and formulate measures to prevent recurrence, and it is also conducting a reassessment to 
determine whether there are any similar incidents in the Group.
The IHI Group has made group-wide efforts to prevent recurrence of the improper inspection incident that occurred at its Mizuho 
Works in 2019 in the civil aero engine maintenance business. However, the fact that this incident has occurred once again makes 
us believe that its efforts to date have been insufficient.
In order to quickly recover the trust of all stakeholders, the IHI Group will work as one to ensure a renewed awareness of 
compliance, improve the organizational culture, and create a system to prevent similar incidents from occurring again.
Although the IHI Group recorded a loss in the current fiscal year due to the impact of additional inspection program for shipped 
PW1100G-JM engines, the policy of allocating investments to growth and development businesses remains unchanged. In 
addition, the IHI Group will proceed with cost reductions and a reassessment of investment priorities, while at the same time 
working to strengthen operating cash flow in order to secure funds for investment. Furthermore, the IHI Group will strengthen its 
financial position by increasing equity through business portfolio optimization and asset sales, etc.

<Long-term management>
ESG management
The IHI Group is seeking to create a world where nature and technology work in unity through addressing social issues in three 
main areas by “becoming carbon-neutral,” “preventing and mitigating disasters,” and “enriching lives of all people.” The IHI 
Group is doing its part to enable flourishing societies while taking steps to halt global climate change through mitigation by 
reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and through adaptation by preparing for the impact to reduce the negative effects from 
climate change.
- Solving social issues
The IHI Group has pledged to make its complete value chain carbon-neutral by 2050. The IHI Group aims to be carbon-neutral in 
its processes overall by reducing the direct and indirect (Scope 1 and 2) GHG emissions from its business activities as well as 
Scope 3 emissions from the upstream and downstream processes in its value chain. Specifically, the IHI Group will work in two 
actions: “transition” for its existing technologies and “transformation” primarily through new technologies.
In addition, the IHI Group is helping to realize safe, secure, and comfortable communities by improving infrastructure to be more 
economical and disaster resilient, and by constructing infrastructure management systems that utilize sensing and monitoring 
technologies.
- Human rights
The Basic Code of Conduct for the IHI Group reflects its Management Philosophy and outlines what it should do to be aware of 
global issues and to meet the expectations of all stakeholders. In accordance with the Basic Code of Conduct for the IHI Group, it 
established the IHI Group Human Rights Policy in December 2020. The IHI Group is conducting human rights awareness 
activities following international standards to fulfill our responsibility to respect the human rights of all by fostering a respectful 
corporate culture and promoting human rights throughout its business activities. The IHI Group also enforces the IHI Group 
Procurement Policy to fulfill its responsibility and work with its business partners for CSR procurement in its supply chain.
The IHI Group is using its value chain to protect against and reduce the negative impacts of its business activities on its 
stakeholders and rights-holders as part of its efforts to enrich the lives of all people.
- Diversity, equity, and inclusion
Welcoming diversity and accurately understanding and responding to changes in the social environment are essential to a 
sustainable society.
- 19 -
It is necessary that every employee understanding the corporate mission and management philosophy of “contributing to the 
development of society” and the goal to “create a world where nature and technology work in unity”. The IHI Group believes that 
key elements of sustainable growth are to align the organization and its employees and ultimately to maintain a relationship where 
it contributes to each other’s growth.
In addition, with diversity, equity, and inclusion that respects and accepts the differences of individuals as fundamental value, the 
IHI Group is creating an environment where human resources with various backgrounds, distinct experiences, and original 
perspectives can play an active role. The IHI Group will also expand the human resources structure to provide employees various 
opportunities to acquire broader perspectives and experience.
- Securing and Maintaining Stakeholder Trust
To use IHI Group’s business to solve social issues and enhance corporate value, the IHI Group needs a foundation to maximize its 
inherent strengths and active dialogue with all its stakeholders.
- 20 -
2.   Views and initiatives regarding sustainability
Since its establishment in 1853, the IHI Group has been helping to resolve social issues from one era to the next underpinned by its 
management philosophies of “Contribute to the development of society through technology” and “Human resources are our single 
most valuable asset.” Meanwhile, with the Group addressing ever-changing social issues and placing greater consideration on the 
natural environment and society in aiming to achieve a sustainable society and persisting corporate growth, the “IHI Group’s ESG 
Management” was released in November 2021 to identify business opportunities that involve resolving such challenges.
In seeking to enable sustainability in both the global environment and people living there, the IHI Group has set its vision on creating 
“a World where Nature and Technology Work in Unity” in terms of a society where all people, including future generations, are able 
to live abundantly and with peace of mind. To such ends, the Group has identified material issues to be prioritized in terms of 
tackling climate change, upholding human rights, building a diverse and inclusive human resources, and securing and maintaining 
stakeholder trust.
Forward-looking statements in the text are based on the Group's judgements as of the end of the current fiscal year (March 31, 2024).
(1) Governance
The IHI Group believes that giving rise to a sustainable society hinges on engaging in ESG Management in a manner exhibiting 
distinct values in relation to its contribution and responsibility toward the environment and society, and in relation to its governance 
for achieving such ends.
The ESG management has involved establishing the ESG Management Promotion Committee to serve as a forum for identifying 
matters deemed important as material issues then holding discussions and making decisions on implementation guidelines, 
promotion frameworks, and action plans. The ESG Management Promotion Committee meets twice per year, in principle. It is 
chaired by the CEO and consists entirely of officers ranked executive officer and above.
Addressing Group-wide issues, such as the environment, human rights and compliance, entails establishing Group-wide 
committees, as necessary, which serves as a structure where policies deliberated and decided upon by such committees are reflected 
in specific measures of each division.
Among discussions in these committees, those related to making important managerial decisions are submitted to the Board of 
Directors subsequent to their deliberation by the Management Committee, which serves as the decision-making body for business 
execution.
In addition, for the purpose of promoting the ESG Management, individuals’ performance evaluation indicators based on the 
missions of each director, which are the evaluation indicators of performance-based incentive for directors (excluding outside 
directors), include initiatives to reduce GHG emissions, improve employee engagement, and promote diversity, equity and 
inclusion (DE&I).

(2) Risk management
In addition to short-term business risks, the IHI Group also manages risks associated with sustainability that may cause changes in 
the business environment on a medium to long term basis as risks pertaining to its business activities. Specifically, this involves 
evaluating the impact such risks impose on the IHI Group over the medium to long term, and incorporating such assessment into 
the short-term business risk profile. The Group accordingly clarifies roles and responsibilities of the internal audit divisions, 
corporate divisions, Business Areas, and business divisions including affiliated companies, and manages them within a multi-
layered risk management system.
Under the "Group Management Policies 2023," announced in May 2023, the IHI Group is promoting the ESG Management by 
incorporating environmental and social values into its business evaluations, regarding responses to customers and social issues, 
including climate change measures, as business opportunities.
<Risk Management System>

Details on the risk management system are included in “3. Business risks” under “Ⅱ. Overview of business” of this Annual 
Securities Report.
(3) Climate change strategies, indicators and targets
i. Strategies
The IHI Group considers “Tackling climate change” as a social issue that needs to be addressed on a global scale and as such 
serves as a challenge of greater significance when it comes to its ESG Management.
The IHI Group enlists a two-stage approach in pursuing initiatives to mitigate climate change in terms of reducing GHG emissions 
utilizing its existing technologies and existing facilities, and also reducing GHG emissions by building new technologies and 
mechanisms. The IHI Group views efforts to achieve carbon neutrality across its entire value chain as a business opportunity, and it 
will transform lifecycle businesses targeting the Group’s products to those targeting its customers’ value chains, thereby enhancing 
the environmental value the IHI Group provides and creating economic value. Management resources created through the lifecycle 
businesses from the customer value chain perspective are invested in developing new technologies and new systems that contribute 
to carbon neutrality, as well as in growth and development-focus businesses, leading to sustained high growth. The IHI Group will 
also actively adopt these new technologies and systems within the Group, thereby giving rise to early achievement of carbon 
neutrality in its business activities.
In its initiatives to adapt to climate change, the IHI Group views the promotion of the construction and realization of safe and 
secure social infrastructure from the viewpoint of maintenance, disaster prevention and disaster mitigation as business 
opportunities, especially for the Social Infrastructure segment. The IHI Group will contribute to solve social issues through disaster 
prevention and mitigation businesses such as wide-area management of water utilization and watershed flood control to address 
natural disasters, which have grown more frequent in recent years.
The IHI Group conducted simple scenario analyses of four main business domains significantly impacted by climate change: 
Energy Business, Bridge and water gates Business, Vehicular supercharger Business, and Civil aero engines Business. The IHI 
Group defined two scenarios: (1) a carbon-neutral world (high-transition risk scenario), (2) a world greatly impacted by climate 
change (high-physical risk scenario). The IHI Group then categorized the risks, opportunities, and countermeasures of each 
scenario, distinguishing between those that are specific to each business and those which are shared across all businesses.
<Main Risks, Opportunities, and Countermeasures Specific to Each Business>
- 23 -
<Main Risks and Countermeasures Shared Across All Businesses>
Details on matters such as the lifecycle businesses as well as the growth and development businesses are included in “1. 
Management policies, business environment and issues to be addressed” under “Ⅱ. Overview of business” of this Annual Securities 
Report.
ii. Indicators and targets
The IHI Group has pledged to attain “Carbon Neutrality by 2050” with the aim of achieving carbon neutrality across its entire 
value chain by the year 2050. The IHI Group aims to be carbon-neutral in its processes overall by reducing Scope 3 GHG 
emissions from the upstream and downstream processes, in addition to reducing the direct and indirect (Scope 1 and 2) GHG 
emissions from its business activities.
The IHI Group has set the target of halving its FY2019 Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by FY2030.
For trends regarding the IHI Group’s CO₂ emissions, please refer to “IHI Sustainability Data Book 2024,” slated for release in 
around August 2024.
(4) Human capital strategies, indicators and targets
i. Strategies
The IHI Group has formulated the “Group Human Resource Strategy 2023” to achieve the two targets under its “Group 
Management Policies 2023”: “Business transformation & business portfolio optimization to achieve strong, sustainable high 
growth” and “Response to operating environmental changes and a corporate structure that enables transformation.”
In order to achieve business transformation and corporate structure reform, it is important to balance a good & strong company and 
personal growth & happiness. The IHI Group has therefore defined this as its ideal vision for the future. The IHI Group will 
promote the development of organizations and human capital capable of solving challenges faced by customers, industries and 
society by combining new leadership with agile self-transformation capability and thus committing to Goal achievement. 
Furthermore, by prioritizing the respect for humanity through the success and happiness of employees and new partnerships. To 
achieve the sustainability vision for the future, FY2023 was positioned as a turning point in terms of an evaluation axis, time axis 
and relationship. 3 material issues are addressed and 11 priority measures are implemented, aiming to induce behavioral 
transformation in all employees and foster an organizational culture capable of accomplishing reform.
- 24 -
<Group Human Resource Strategy 2023: Material Issues & Priority Measures>
ii. Indicators and targets
The IHI Group aims to become an enterprise group that empowers human resources to resolve issues by coordinating and 
collaborating with a variety of stakeholders, and that also upholds the human rights of everyone involved in its businesses. More 
specifically, the IHI Group is spearheading efforts to achieve a more diverse range of senior management candidates while also 
leveraging the broad perspectives and ideas of the younger generation in management.
The proportion of female officers serves as an indicator regarding senior management candidate diversification. The IHI Group 
endorses the “Challenge Initiatives for 30% of Executives to be Women by 2030” of the Japan Business Federation (Keidanren) 
and have set a target of achieving a 30% or higher ratio of female officers by the year 2030. The IHI Group has set the ratio of 
female managers and the female recruitment rate as indicators, and it aims to achieve the ratio of female managers of 7% by 2026 
and female recruitment rate of approximately 20% among university graduates by 2026.
The IHI Group will also monitor findings of employee-awareness surveys to assess progress in achieving systemic reform and 
cultivation of a climate for evaluating efforts to take on challenges of transformation.
For results of these indicators, please refer to “IHI Sustainability Data Book 2024,” slated for release in around August 2024.
Related indicators and results are also included in “5. Information about employees” under “I. Overview of company” of this 
Annual Securities Report.
(5) Human rights strategies, indicators and targets
i. Strategies
The IHI Group established the “IHI Group Human Rights Policy” in December 2020. In accordance with international standards 
and the Policy, the IHI Group promotes initiatives to respect human rights throughout its business activities, including its supply 
chains. To respect the human rights of those affected by its business activities and to reduce human rights risks, it promotes the 
process of human rights due diligence in line with the United Nations’ Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
To evaluate human rights risks, in 2021, the IHI Group sought out the advice of outside experts and carried out human rights risk 
assessments of IHI and IHI Group businesses in Japan and overseas. The IHI Group identified six critical human rights issues 
pertinent to the IHI Group and designated IHI Group employees and suppliers as its highest priority rights-holders. Then, in 
December 2021, the IHI Group began conducting human rights impact assessments of IHI Group sites in Japan and overseas, to 
assess the situations surrounding these material human rights issues.
In April 2024, the IHI Group opened a complaint desk  for human rights violations, encompassing all stakeholders, including the 
IHI Group’s value chain.
If the IHI Group discovers human rights risks caused by IHI Group business activities, or if it discovers that its business activities 
- 25 -
are involved in human rights risks, through the results of the assessments or via reports to the complaint desk, it consults with 
related stakeholders and take appropriate procedures to correct and remediate the issue.
<Overall Human Rights Due Diligence>
<Material Human Rights Issues>
ii. Indicators and targets
By FY2024, the IHI Group plans to conduct human rights impact assessments for roughly 160 IHI Group companies. From the 
second half of FY2021 to FY2022, the IHI Group conducted human rights impact assessments at 59 sites, and also at 37 sites in 
FY2023. Each cycle of assessments will be three years long, so from FY2025 onward the IHI Group will perform monitoring in 
accordance with its implementation plans.

3.   Business risks
(1) Basic policies for risk management
The IHI Group recognizes that risk management is one of the top business priorities for the Group and strives to reinforce its 
overall capabilities in that regard. The basic objectives of risk management are ensuring business continuity, ensuring the safety 
of executives, employees and their families, protecting management resources, and maintaining public trust in the Group. Also, 
the Group has formulated the following action guidelines and performs risk management in accordance with them.
1 Ensure the continuity of the IHI Group’s business operations
2 Improve the public reputation of the IHI Group
3 Protect the IHI Group’s management resources
4 Avoid jeopardizing stakeholders’ interests
5 Achieve recovery from damage as soon as possible
6 Take responsible action when an issue arises
7 Meet public requirements regarding risks
(2) Risk management system
The IHI Group established the Risk Management Conference chaired by the CEO. The Conference assesses key general risk 
management matters, and considers policies, annual plans, corrective measures, and other important matters.
The Group has formulated the “IHI Group Key Risk Management Policies” for the risks to be treated on a priority basis, and all 
parent units and Group companies in Japan and abroad independently pursue risk management in keeping with those policies.
Regarding commonly existing risks in the Group, the Group Risk Management Units, which mainly comprise the Group’s 
corporate divisions, provide information and education by leveraging their specialties and support risk management activity at 
each division. Additionally, the Internal Audit Division audits the maintenance and operation status of the Group’s risk 
management system and makes efforts  to ensure their propriety.
In order to manage risks thoroughly, after clarifying roles and responsibilities of Internal Audit Division, corporate divisions, 
Business Areas, and business divisions including affiliated companies in risk management, the Group sets a risk management 
system. Business divisions, including affiliated companies, identify risks and respond to them directly. Business Areas monitor 
and provide guidance on the risk management activities of the business divisions and detect new risk signs. The corporate 
divisions evaluate and advise on the risk management activities of the business divisions and Business Areas, issue alerts for 
unrecognized risks, detect new risk signs, and implement measures against occurred risk items. The Internal Audit Division 
ensures these risk management functions.
(3) Risk management activities for FY2024
In terms of major themes on “IHI Group Key Risk Management Policies” for FY2024, the IHI Group will focus on the following 
matters.
i. Response to risks that hinder the securing of a robust business operation foundation
  - Compliance
  - Quality assurance
  - Economic security
  - Information security
  - Upholding human rights
  - Human resource risks
ii. Response to risks that hinder the execution of business scenarios.
In “response to risks that hinder the securing of a robust business operation foundation”, with regard to compliance and quality 
assurance system, under the “IHI Group Code of Conduct” and “IHI Group Quality Declaration” that were formulated in 
FY2019, the IHI Group is working to build a working environment where past lessons would not be forgotten with initiatives 
related to “Compliance Day” (May 10 every year) on which the entire IHI Group pledge to ensure thorough compliance and 
creating workplaces where everyone has a voice. On September 12, 2023, our subsidiary's mechanical parking system business 
was subjected to an on-site inspection by the Japan Fair Trade Commission on suspicion of violation of the Antimonopoly Act.  
In addition, on April 24, 2024, it was discovered that inappropriate corrections had been made to the trial operation records of 
marine and land engines at a subsidiary of our company, and this was announced publicly. the Group takes this situation very 
seriously and will strive to further improve compliance. Initiatives with respect to economic security, information security, 
upholding human rights, and securing human resources are stated in “(4) Business risks”. As for “response to risks that hinder 
the execution of business scenarios”, the Group is prioritizing the management of risks that impair the ability of the four 
Business Areas to execute their respective strategies in order to respond to them quickly and appropriately, while keenly 
- 27 -
grasping the drastic changes in the business environment surrounding the Group including the response to the impact of the 
sudden changes in the prices for material and equipment and sudden changes in the international situation.
In order to systematically check the latent risks in the business plan, the Group are also constantly assessing and confirming the 
response plans and implementation progress for a wide range of business-related risks and, if needed, executing revision to the 
response plans including risk assessment.
(4) Business risks
With regard to matters included in the “Overview of business,” “Information about facilities,” and “Financial information” 
sections in this Annual Securities Report, the items below are some of the main risks that could potentially have an adverse 
impact on the operating results and financial position of the IHI Group. Note that forward-looking statements are based on the 
Group’s judgements as of the end of the current fiscal year (March 31,2024).  In light of the risks described below, the Group has 
put in place the necessary risk management systems, making every possible effort to avoid the occurrence of risks and to 
minimize the impact when risks do occur.
The Group will build a system that is prepared for any eventuality in light of a social environment in which instability is the 
norm, including the expansion of geopolitical risks, progression of inflation, human resource shortages, and frequent catastrophic 
disasters.  the Group will also accelerate its transformation into a corporate structure capable of responding to dramatic changes 
in the environment.
The Group treats the appropriate identification of “risks” and “opportunities” arising from changes in the business environment 
as a task for the entire group, and is working to identify risks that may be latent in business transformation beyond the 
boundaries of conventional businesses in the changing environment, to determine and analyze significant risks, and to promote 
flexible risk management.
          i. Social responsibility
a. Compliances
The IHI Group believes that in order to achieve sustainable growth together with society and our customers, it is important to 
meet the expectations of our stakeholders and earn their trust. Based on this belief, the Group has summarized what the Group do 
in "Basic Code of Conduct for the IHI Group", which the Group expects our officers and employees to follow. In addition, the 
Group has established the Compliance Committee, a company-wide organization under the Risk Management Conference, to 
deliberate on and formulate important compliance-related policies and promote activities. Furthermore, the IHI Group operates 
"IHI Group Compliance Hotline" as an internal reporting system to prevent or promptly identify violations or potential violations 
of laws, regulations, internal rules, and internal and external rules by all officers and employees, and to take appropriate 
corrective measures. However, in the event of a violation of laws or regulations by some officers or employees, the Group's 
business performance and financial position may be adversely affected due to losses resulting from fines, surcharges, or 
additional taxation, lost opportunities resulting from administrative penalties such as suspension of business, or a decline in 
social reputation resulting from such violations. On September 12, 2023, our subsidiary's mechanical parking system business 
was subjected to an on-site inspection by the Japan Fair Trade Commission on suspicion of violation of the Antimonopoly Act. 
The Group solemnly accepts the fact that The Group was subjected to the on-site inspection and are fully cooperating with the 
investigation by the Japan Fair Trade Commission. In the event that any administrative action is ordered as a result of the 
inspection, the Group's business performance may be affected. In addition, on April 24, 2024, it was discovered that 
inappropriate corrections had been made to the trial operation records of marine and land engines at a subsidiary of our 
company, and this was announced publicly.  The Group takes the occurrence of this situation very seriously and have established 
a special investigation committee consisting mainly of outside experts, including lawyers. The entire group will take strict 
measures based on the findings and recommendations of the special investigative committee.
b. Environmental conservation
Within its manufacturing process, the IHI Group has business offices, subsidiaries, and other entities using substances that could 
cause adverse effects including pollution of the atmosphere, water, or soil. The Group takes the utmost care in managing these 
substances, and even in the unlikely event of substances leaking outside the Group’s facilities, the Group has measures in place 
to minimize their spread. However, an unanticipated situation could arise, leading to deterioration in the Group’s reputation 
within society, as well as liability for damages. If this risk materializes, the Group’s operating results and financial position could 
be adversely affected.
c. Human rights and diversity
In order to maintain the IHI Group's business foundation and link it to future growth, the Group respects human rights 
- 28 -
throughout our business activities (e.g., by establishing a whistleblower contact point as a grievance mechanism for stakeholders 
in the value chain). The Group strives to foster an organizational culture in which individuals with diverse personalities and 
values can play an active role. However, if an event that violates or disrespects human rights occurs in the Group's business 
activities, the Group may lose social credibility or be liable for suspension of transactions with customers or compensation for 
damages. In addition, a lack of diversity in the decision-making process in management could have a negative impact on the 
Group's performance and financial position.
d. Control of affiliated companies
The IHI Group is committed to providing high value to its customers through group management. To this end, each company in 
the Group must not only conduct its business in accordance with the laws and social norms of each country and region but must 
also promote appropriate group management. However, inappropriate responses or independent management decisions by 
affiliated companies in response to other risks may cause damage or loss of reputation among customers, resulting in adverse 
effects on our group's business performance and social credibility.
e. Health and safety
The IHI Group takes all possible measures to manage health and safety at its business offices and construction sites. However, in 
the unlikely event of an unexpected accident, disaster, or other incident, production activities could be impeded, leading to an 
adverse effect on the Group’s operating results and financial position.  The Group maintains a range of property and casualty 
insurance policies, among other measures, but if a major accident or disaster were to occur, the Group may not be able to claim 
insurance to cover all its losses.
ii. Preparing for changes in the external environment
a. Competitive environment and business strategy
Under the medium-term management plan "Group Management Policy 2023," the IHI Group is promoting initiatives to achieve 
sustainable high growth through a bold shift of management resources to growth and development businesses, even in a social 
environment where instability is the norm.
In the ammonia value chain business, which The Group is developing as a pillar of our growth businesses, a significant change 
in the assumed fuel ammonia demand, the timing of its diffusion, and other preconditions could affect our Group's future 
business portfolio.
b. Partnerships, M&A, and business integration
The IHI Group conducts joint business activities with numerous other companies in the form of joint ventures and cooperation in 
marketing, technology, and production. The Group also makes effective use of M&A in order to expedite business expansion 
into growth markets, supplement its underlying technologies, and generate synergies, among other purposes. However, such 
activities may not deliver the benefits originally expected due to changes in the economic environment, legal regulations, 
unforeseen cost increases, or other factors. Moreover, if the Group judges that the benefits originally expected cannot be 
obtained, it may decide to suspend or terminate business integration based on a partnership with another company. The Group’s 
operating results and financial position could be adversely affected as a result.
In the ongoing additional inspection program for shipped PW1100G-JM engines, The Group, as a participant in the PW1100G-
JM engine program with an approximately 15% share, expects to incur compensation costs and additional maintenance costs, 
etc. The impact of these costs was recorded in the consolidated financial statements in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended 
March 31, 2024.
The Group will continue its efforts to reduce the burden on airlines and restore the trust of customers.
c. Country risks
The IHI Group conducts its activities including procurement, production, export, sales, and construction on a global basis. If the 
continuation of business activities or the operation of business sites could become difficult due to political or economic turmoil 
in each country and region and a resulting freeze on currency exchange transactions, or debt defaults, or seizure of investment 
assets, occurrence of unforeseen acts of terrorism or labor disputes, political instability, defaults, or other factors, the Group’s 
operating results and financial position could be adversely affected. Against these risks, the Group endeavors to ensure that it is 
fully covered by trade insurance, strives to gather information regarding country risks and to raise awareness among Group 
employees, and strengthens structure such as preparation and review of business continuity plan (BCP).
The Group perceives that increasing uncertainty such as growing tensions in the Middle East, Ukraine, and Taiwan, political 
conflicts between the U.S. and China, and the expanding impact of economic security issues, among other factors.
- 29 -
d. Economic security
With the recent advance of globalization, deepening economic interdependence among nations has made economic activities and 
security inseparable. Sudden changes in the international situation, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the political 
conflicts between the U.S. and China, have led to changes in the policies and laws and regulations of various countries, including 
Japan, and have created challenges related to economic security, such as strengthening supply chains and developing cutting-
edge key technologies.
If  the Group conducts conduct transactions in violation of these policies or laws and regulations, or if our response to these 
issues is inadequate, our reputation and social credibility may be damaged, leading to lost sales opportunities or business 
shutdowns. Furthermore, restrictions on our production, procurement, export, and other business activities could adversely affect 
the group's performance and financial position.
e. Natural disasters, disease, conflict, terrorism
The IHI Group reviews its regulations and business continuity plan (BCP), conducts emergency drills as necessary, and 
maintains appropriate insurance to minimize the impact of any event that may disrupt business operations such as the spread of a 
large-scale infectious disease such as a new coronavirus, an earthquake, flood, or other severe disaster, or a criminal act such as 
terrorism. However, a disaster on an unanticipated scale could make it impossible to execute business operations appropriately. 
Such eventualities could adversely affect the Group’s operating results and financial position.
ⅲ. Management Resources
a. Human resource risks
In order to maintain the IHI Group's business foundation and link it to future growth, it is necessary to acquire, retain, and 
develop the human resources required for business operations.  If there is a failure to hire outside personnel or secure key 
personnel, or a failure to properly assign personnel, the Group’s future growth, operating results and financial position could be 
adversely affected.
b. Financial activities
(a)Currency movements
Currency movements have impacts on the IHI Group’s operating results and financial position. For example, when the yen 
appreciates against foreign currencies, the Group’s income from construction work for export denominated in foreign currencies 
decreases in value after conversion into yen, and when the yen depreciates it leads to increases in the yen values of expenditures 
for overseas procurement denominated in local currencies. The Group therefore endeavors to hedge against the risk of imbalance 
in its position with regard to assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies by ensuring full use of forward exchange 
contracts, and marry and netting, based on a set policy. However, exchange rates may fluctuate more than anticipated, and if this 
risk materializes, the Group’s operating results and financial position could be adversely affected.
(b)Interest rate movements
If interest rates rise, the IHI Group’s interest expenses increase and its financial balance deteriorates. Moreover, the Group may 
be subject to less favorable financing terms when taking out loans or issuing bonds, adversely affecting its fund procurement. As 
a consequence, therefore, the Group’s operating results and financial position could also be adversely affected.
(c)Fund procurement and credit ratings
The IHI Group’s loans include syndicated loans with associated financial covenants relating to shareholders’ equity and profits. 
If the Group were to violate these covenants as a result of deterioration in business performance or any other cause, the terms of 
the loan in question could be revised, or an obligation to repay the loan before the due date could arise, leading to an adverse 
effect on the Group’s operating results and financial position.
Moreover, if a credit rating agency downgrades the Group’s credit rating, the Group could be forced to execute its financing 
transactions under disadvantageous terms, or it could become unable to execute certain transactions, adversely affecting its fund 
procurement. As a consequence, therefore, the Group’s operating results and financial position could also be adversely affected.
(d)Loan guarantees
The IHI Group issues guarantees and takes other appropriate measures with regard to loans it has confirmed as necessary and 
rational in order to conduct its business activities. However, if the debtor’s financial position deteriorates as a result of a 
prolonged downturn in the economic environment or a business failure, the creditors may demand that the Group fulfills these 
guarantees. Information regarding loan guarantees and related measures is included in Note “40. Contingent liabilities” under 
- 30 -
“Notes to consolidated financial statements” of the “Financial information” section in this Annual Securities Report.
(e)Taxation
To calculate its deferred tax assets, the IHI Group books or reverses individual assets, including forecasts and assumptions 
regarding future taxable income. However, if forecasts and assumptions regarding future taxable income change and the Group 
judges that part or all of the deferred tax assets cannot be recovered, the Group’s deferred tax assets could be decreased. The 
Group’s operating results and financial position could be adversely affected as a result.
Furthermore, when transaction prices are determined between group companies across national borders, the IHI Group makes 
every effort to comply with the transfer pricing taxation system that is applicable. However, in the event that the IHI Group 
receives a statement from a tax authority pointing out that a transaction price is inappropriate, the penalty tax or double taxation 
that arises could adversely affect the Group’s operating results and financial position.
(f)Management of credit exposure
The IHI Group supplies products and services to customers worldwide, and most of its sales transactions employ credit or 
promissory notes. With regard to these transactions, the Group as a whole endeavors to bolster its system for management of 
credit exposure and to ensure rigorous protection of receivables. Despite such measures, however, a key customer could fall into 
bankruptcy, making it impossible to recover receivables from that customer. If this risk materializes, the Group’s operating 
results and financial position could be adversely affected.
Due to the filing for bankruptcy by an airline company in May 2023, there is a possibility that a portion of the accounts 
receivable that the Group indirectly hold in the engine program in which the Group participates through an international joint 
venture company for civil aero engines may become uncollectible. In response to this matter, the Group is taking steps for the 
enhancement of debt management in order to reduce the risk of debt collection.
c. Information security
The IHI Group takes appropriate information security measures when using technical and administrative information, as well as 
information systems for processing such information in its business. The Group is also strengthening these measures in response 
to the increasing sophistication of cyber-attacks and the rise in teleworking, while thoroughly educating employees on 
information security. However, cyber-attacks, loss or theft of information equipment and documents, network outages, or 
inadequate hardware and software could result in information leaks or business stoppages, which could adversely affect the 
Group's operating results and financial position.
ⅳ. Corporate activities and engineering
a. Research and development
Information relating to the IHI Group’s research and development activities is included in “6. Research and development 
activities” under “Ⅱ. Overview of business” in this Annual Securities Report. Due to the nature of the Group’s business, these 
research and development activities are characterized by the fact that they require large financial investments and long 
development periods. Research and development could therefore fail to lead to satisfactory outcomes because opportunities for 
practical application are lost, timings are inconsistent with the Group’s business strategies or market trends, or for other reasons. 
Such eventualities could adversely affect the Group’s operating results and financial position.
b. Intellectual property management
The IHI Group endeavors to appropriately safeguard its intellectual property (by obtaining patents, utility models, or rights of 
prior use). However, the products and services handled by the Group are broad-ranging, and it can sometimes prove difficult to 
completely prevent attempts by third parties such as imitating or analyzing the Group’s products or services.
Moreover, the products and services the Group is developing for the future could potentially infringe on the intellectual property 
rights of other companies and organizations, or the Group could fail to handle an employee’s invention appropriately, resulting 
in a claim for compensation or other redress being made against the Group. Such eventualities could adversely affect the Group’s 
operating results and financial position.
c. Project management
The IHI Group believes that the success or failure of both large projects and investments significantly depends on initial 
planning, especially for new projects or those not implemented for some time. In response, the Group has established a risk 
management system with screening processes before accepting orders or making investments.
 In many cases, the Group manufactures products for large projects after concluding individual order contracts with customers 
and conducts a multifaceted internal review before concluding an order contract. However, such factors as unanticipated changes 
- 31 -
in the economic environment, inadequate prior investigation, unexpected complications, or a business downturn at a joint 
venture partner or other partner may cause construction work that exceeds the original estimate, payment of penalties if the 
Group is unable to achieve the level of performance or delivery date required by the customer, or additional costs. As a result, 
the Group’s operating results and financial position could be adversely affected.  In addition, the Group makes every possible 
effort to avoid risks associated with cancellation of an order contract at the request of a customer, including insertion of a penalty 
clause in the terms of its order contracts, but it may not always be possible to fully recover costs disbursed. As a result, the 
Group’s performance and financial position could be adversely affected.
For large investments, the Group conducts an internal review of the investment execution plan from the perspective of 
profitability and risk before the investment is made. However, there is a possibility that the target investment efficiency may not 
be achieved or losses may be recorded due to changes in the economic environment or market that could not be assumed at the 
time of investment decision-making, or troubles caused by the company or its partners, which may adversely affect the Group's 
performance and financial position.
For both large projects and large investments, the Group conducts a multifaceted and complex risk review in collaboration with 
internal and external experts and the corporate review department in the pre-commitment and pre-investment review process.
After accepting an order or making an investment, the Group strengthens its monitoring of initial plans and responds to new 
events and risks, in collaboration with each Business Area's risk management departments, to ensure thorough project risk 
management.
d. Procurement and logistics
Whilst the IHI Group endeavors to manufacture key components within the Group, it also takes delivery of raw materials, 
components, and services from multiple external suppliers. The Group strives to ensure reliable procurement by working to 
constantly gather information on market trends for its key raw materials and components. In addition, the Group takes steps to 
reduce risk, such as rigorously monitoring suppliers’ product quality and delivery dates, and diversifying procurement sources to 
avoid excessive concentration or dependency on particular suppliers. However, in case of occurrence of such problems as sudden 
changes in the prices for material and equipment, or in the demand and supply balance, and rise in procurement costs in the 
process of promoting CSR procurement for the purpose of respecting human rights and realizing sustainable society, as well as 
in the international situation, in addition to disruption of our supply chain caused by a severe disaster and a spread of infectious 
diseases, they may cause problems including increased costs or delayed deliveries. These problems could lead to deterioration in 
the Group’s operating results and financial position.
e. Design and manufacturing
As described in “2. Major facilities” under “Ⅲ. Information about facilities” in this Annual Securities Report, the IHI Group 
owns production sites in a variety of locations. A severe disaster affecting the Group’s production facilities, production 
delays/suspension, supply chain disruption, a power outage, inability to obtain materials or equipment, or a power restriction 
affecting production activities caused from infections including COVID-19 and geopolitical changes such as the situation 
involving Russia and Ukraine, could occur on a greater scale than anticipated in their business continuity plan (BCP), or 
adjustment of production capacity may not be able to keep pace if production volume were to fluctuate more suddenly than 
anticipated. Such eventualities could lead to deterioration in the Group’s operating results and financial position.
f. Quality assurance
The IHI Group establishes quality management system and develops structures and systems to assure quality in order to provide 
products and services realizing customers’ satisfaction, safely, and security.  This system includes the reflection of necessary 
requirements including customer demands and responses to risks assumed in the planning stage.
However, an unanticipated situation related to quality assurance could arise, leading to deterioration in customer’s evaluation 
and the Group’s reputation within society, as well as liability for damages. If this risk materializes, the Group’s operating results 
and financial position could be adversely affected.

4.   Management’s analysis of financial position, operating results and cash flows
(1) Overview of operating results, etc.
i. Financial position and operating results
a. Operating results
Regarding the global economy during the current fiscal year, the European economy was sluggish due to monetary tightening and 
the impact of the energy situation, etc., and the Chinese economy slowed down due to stagnation in the real estate market, while 
the U.S. economy remained steady supported by a solid employment and income environment even in an environment where 
monetary tightening was maintained. Regarding the Japanese economy, amid an improving employment and income environment, 
the economy has been recovering gradually, although it is still affected by global inflation.
In the second quarter ended September 30, 2023, the IHI Group recorded a significant loss due to the additional inspection 
program for shipped PW1100G-JM engines and settlement of litigation involving IHI’s consolidated subsidiary.
With respect to the additional inspection program for shipped PW1100G-JM engines, costs related to compensation, additional 
maintenance, and so forth are expected to be incurred. There has been no change in these assumptions during the fourth quarter 
ended March 31, 2024. Currently, IHI is taking measures to shorten the period of aircraft on the ground, such as increasing the 
maintenance capacity of the factory and securing a stable supply of parts. The IHI Group will work with program partners to 
enhance the overall maintenance capacity to reduce the impacts on airlines as customers and to restore their confidence.
With regard to the improper conduct related to the engine test run records that occurred in the Power systems Business, the IHI 
Group will sincerely respond to the customers to whom the subject products delivered, and will also investigate the cause and 
formulate measures to prevent recurrence of such improper conduct.
In the IHI Group’s main business, the Civil aero engines Business, sales of main units of engines and spare parts have been steady 
due to the recovery in passenger demand. In addition, orders for defense equipment are increasing due to the significant increase in 
the defense budget under the government policy of fundamentally reinforcing Japan’s defense capabilities. In order to respond to 
the expected increase in demand for civil aero engines and defense equipment, the IHI Group is promoting efforts to increase 
production capacity and achieve the world’s highest level of production efficiency.
In the Vehicular turbochargers Business, the production volume greatly exceeded the forecast at the beginning of the year due to 
the relaxation of supply constraints of semiconductor parts and other components, and the impact of sales promotion measures in 
China as a trend in the overall automobile market. Although electric vehicles are becoming popular, the speed still remains in flux. 
While responding to changes in the market, the IHI Group is maintaining and preparing its supply system, including business 
structure reforms, in order to respond to the demand reliably.
In the Carbon solutions Businesses, the introduction of decarbonized power sources is being promoted by the revision of the 
Energy Conservation Law, and demand for renewable energy technologies is on the rise overseas. The IHI Group is expanding its 
lifecycle businesses while contributing to the enhancement of the value of customers' plants through fuel conversion and other 
measures.
Under this business environment, orders received of the IHI Group for the current fiscal year increased 0.8% from the previous 
fiscal year to ¥1,376.8 billion. Revenue decreased 2.2% from the previous fiscal year to ¥1,322.5 billion mainly due to the impact 
of the additional inspection program for shipped PW1100G-JM engines.
In terms of profit, operating profit decreased ¥152.1 billion to a loss of ¥70.1 billion due to the aforementioned decrease in revenue 
and business restructuring expenses for the Vehicular turbochargers Business, despite the effects of yen depreciation, higher sales 
of spare parts for civil aero engines, and expansion of lifecycle businesses etc. Profit attributable to owners of parent was a loss of 
¥68.2 billion.

For reference, as previously mentioned, excluding the impact of the additional inspection program for shipped PW1100G-JM 
engines and settlement of litigation involving IHI’s consolidated subsidiary, which were recorded in the second quarter ended 
September 30, 2023, results by reportable segment are as follows.
Note:     Monetary amounts less than first decimal are rounded down, and ratios less than one unit are rounded off.
<Resources, Energy and Environment>
The movement toward carbon neutrality is accelerating in many countries around the world. Not only in the energy sector, but also 
in the industrial sector, including steel and chemicals, there is a growing movement to shift materials away from fossil resources. 
At COP28, the expansion of the use of nuclear energy was declared in addition to the previous movements.
Under this business environment, orders received decreased due to the impact of losses from settlement of litigation involving 
IHI’s consolidated subsidiary and the absence of large project orders received in the previous fiscal year.
Revenue increased due to steady growth in the Carbon solutions Business and steady progress in large power generation projects 
in Southeast Asia, despite the aforementioned loss from settlement of litigation involving IHI’s consolidated subsidiary and a 
decrease in construction volume in the Nuclear energy Business.
Operating profit decreased due to a loss from settlement of litigation involving IHI’s consolidated subsidiary, despite the impact of 
increased revenues from the life cycle business in the Carbon solutions Business and a large power generation project in Southeast 
Asia.
<Social Infrastructure>
In Japan, the national land resilience plan is being implemented as a countermeasure against aging infrastructure and severe 
natural disasters caused by climate change, and efforts are being promoted for watershed flood control, road network functional 
enhancement, maintenance and repair of aging bridges, and a shift to preventive maintenance of infrastructure. Meanwhile, as 
labor shortages in the construction sector have become the norm, it is necessary to promote labor saving, automation, digital 
transformation (DX) and productivity improvement more than ever before because the overtime work limit has been applied in the 
construction industry since April 2024.
Under this business environment, orders received increased for the Bridges and water gates Business.
Revenue remained mostly unchanged.
Operating profit decreased due to recording the necessary costs in advance in the Bridges and water gates Business.
- 35 -
<Industrial Systems and General-Purpose Machinery>
Soaring material and labor costs are becoming the norm throughout the industry, and market conditions remain uncertain, although 
slowdowns in the semiconductor market and the Chinese economy are expected to recover in the second half of FY2024.
On the other hand, the growing demand for carbon neutrality in industry, labor shortages in developed countries due to declining 
working populations, and changes in international supply chains with economic security in mind are seen as mid- to long-term 
trends in the industrial sector.
Under this business environment, orders received increased mainly for the Vehicular turbochargers Business.
Revenue increased mainly for the Vehicular turbochargers Business and the Rotating machineries Business, due in part to the 
impact of a weaker yen.
Operating profit decreased due to an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and the recording of business 
restructuring expenses in the Vehicular turbochargers Business.
<Aero Engine, Space and Defense>
In the Civil aero engines Business, global passenger demand is entering a growth phase from recovery, and aftermarket earnings 
continue to expand. In response to the increased defense budget and market expansion in the space industry, the IHI Group will 
also aim to create new value and improve its competitiveness in the defense and space businesses. On the other hand, supply chain 
disruptions and soaring prices continue, and the future business environment remains uncertain. To build a business structure that 
can overcome changes, the IHI Group will accelerate growth by further strengthening its cost structure, including productivity 
improvement through DX sophistication.
Under this business environment, orders received increased due partly to the expansion of demand in the Defense systems 
Business, despite the impact of the additional inspection program for shipped PW1100G-JM engines.
Revenue decreased due to the additional inspection program for shipped PW1100G-JM engines, despite increased sales of main 
units and spare parts for the Civil aero engines Business and increased demand in the Defense systems Business.
Operating profit increased in the Defense systems Business due to increased orders but decreased in the Civil aero engines 
Business due to the additional inspection program for shipped PW1100G-JM engines.
Note that forward-looking statements are based on the Group’s judgements as of the end of the current fiscal year (March 31, 
2024).
b. Assets and liabilities, and equity
Total assets at the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 were ¥2,097.8 billion, up ¥155.8 billion compared with the end of 
the previous fiscal year. The major items of increase were trade and other receivables, up ¥74.2 billion and inventories, up ¥47.7 
billion.
Total liabilities were ¥1,695.5 billion, up ¥209.8 billion compared with the end of the previous fiscal year. The major item of 
increase was refund liabilities, up ¥154.0 billion, which increased mainly because of the additional inspection program for shipped 
PW1100G-JM engines. And interest-bearing liabilities, including lease liabilities, was ¥574.3 billion, up ¥54.8 billion compared 
with the end of the previous fiscal year. The IHI Group kept moving forward with its efforts to ensure the liquidity of its funds.
Equity was ¥402.2 billion, down ¥53.9 billion compared with the end of the previous fiscal year. This includes loss attributable to 
owners of parent of ¥68.2 billion.
As a result of the above, the ratio of equity attributable to owners of parent decreased from 22.2% at the end of the previous fiscal 
year to 17.9%.

ii. Cash flows
At the end of the current fiscal year, the outstanding balance of cash and cash equivalents (hereinafter, “cash”) was ¥138.8 billion, 
up ¥14.0 billion from the end of the previous fiscal year.
Key factors influencing each cash flow during the current fiscal year are summarized below.
(Cash flows from operating activities)
Net cash flows from operating activities were ¥62.1 billion excess of income (the previous fiscal year: ¥54.1 billion excess of 
income). This was due to profit because the cash impact of the additional inspection program for shipped PW1100G-JM engines 
will not be occurred until the following fiscal year, and the IHI Group has also made progress in expanding its earnings, while 
there were increases in working capital for production increases as the supply chain continues to be unstable in the growing Civil 
aero engines Business.
(Cash flows from investing activities)
Net cash flows from investing activities were ¥51.6 billion excess of expenditure (the previous fiscal year: ¥52.3 billion excess of 
expenditure). This was due to the increase in expenditures from making equipment investments, while there were income from the 
transfer of fixed assets.
(Cash flows from financing activities)
Net cash flows from financing activities were ¥2.5 billion excess of expenditure (the previous fiscal year: ¥24.0 billion excess of 
expenditure). This was due to dividend payments and repayment of financial liabilities, while there were increases in income from 
borrowings.

assumptions” under “Notes to consolidated financial statements” of “Financial information” section in this Annual Securities 
Report.
ii. Details of recognition, analysis and examination of operating results, etc.
The IHI Group’s operating results and results by segment are as presented in “i. Financial position and operating results” of “(1) 
Overview of operating results, etc.”
The IHI Group is promoting initiatives based on “Group Management Policies 2023,” a three-year medium-term management 
plan that begins in FY2023. In order to respond to drastic changes in the business environment and to transform its business into 
one that achieves sustainable high growth, the IHI Group will boldly shift its management resources and invest intensively to both 
growth businesses in the aero engines and rockets fields, which are driving its growth, and development businesses in the clean 
energy field, which is expected to become future business pillars.
In the growing aero engines and rockets fields, global demand for aircraft is expected to grow steadily in the future. The IHI 
Group participates in the development and mass production of best-selling engines from the small to large and ultra-large engine 
classes for civil aero engines, and will respond to the growing demand for newly manufactured engines and aftermarket products. 
In addition, the IHI Group will strengthen its production capacity and develop necessary technologies, aiming to expand its 
defense and space-related businesses, which are expected to grow. In the current fiscal year, although losses were recorded due to 
the additional inspection program for shipped PW1100G-JM engines, the Civil aero engines Business moved into a growth phase 
and the Defense/Space/Civil MRO (Maintenance Repair and Overhaul) businesses also expanded steadily.
In the clean energy field, which is its Development-focus Business, the IHI Group will contribute to the realization of carbon 
neutrality by building its entire value chain for fuel ammonia, from production to storage, transportation, and utilization, while 
applying its technical capabilities. In the current fiscal year, development of the fuel ammonia value chain business progressed 
steadily, including the start of the world's first demonstration testing of 20% fuel ammonia substitution at JERA's Hekinan 
Thermal Power Station.
In its core businesses of Resources, Energy and Environment, Social Infrastructure, and Industrial Systems and General-Purpose 
Machinery, the IHI Group will continue to focus on expanding lifecycle businesses while creating a continuous growth scenario 
through the transformation of its business portfolio and generate cash necessary for investments. In the current fiscal year, revenue 
and orders received in the lifecycle businesses expanded steadily.
In FY2023, although large losses was recorded due to special factors such as the impact of the additional inspection program for 
shipped PW1100G-JM engines, the operating profit margin was 7.0% excluding losses due to one-time special factors, and profits 
were steadily accumulated in the first year of the “Group Management Policies 2023.”
While securing profitability that will lead to the achievement of management targets for FY2025, it is now necessary to improve 
the financial base damaged by special factors. As opposed to the ability to earn profits, capital efficiency is an issue. Therefore, 
the IHI Group is promoting the strengthening of balance sheet management by reducing working capital to improve CCC and 
controlling the balance of debt and equity with an awareness that the cost of capital, which is the hurdle rate for ROIC, should be 
kept at an appropriate level.
In these efforts, the IHI Group will further promote the management that leads to higher capital profitability and efficiency by 
accurately grasping the cost of capital and further analyzing and evaluating it in consideration of its contents and the market’s 
assessment.

4.   Corporate governance, etc.
(1) Outline about corporate governance
(i) Corporate governance system
(a) Basic Views on Corporate Governance
IHI defines corporate governance as a system that assures sustainable growth and maximization of corporate value by 
enhancing management efficiency so that IHI can leverage its innate capabilities to the fullest extent possible. To achieve 
this, IHI targets efficient and appropriate internal decision-making by clearly separating management monitoring and 
supervisory functions from functions related to their business execution of duties. Furthermore, by establishing the relevant 
internal rules and building a system to administer them, IHI ensures appropriate operations across the entire IHI Group.
IHI promotes constant improvement of its corporate governance, aiming to earn the trust and support of its shareholders and 
other stakeholders over the long term.
IHI works to enhance its corporate governance in line with the following basic policies.
- Respect shareholders’ rights and ensure equal treatment
- Strive to cooperate appropriately with shareholders and other stakeholders
- Fulfill our responsibility to be accountable to stakeholders and ensure transparency by appropriately and proactively 
disclosing information relating to IHI
- Clarify the roles and responsibilities of the Board of Directors, the audit & supervisory board members and the Audit & 
Supervisory Board to enable them to adequately fulfill their management-monitoring and supervisory functions
- Conduct constructive dialogues with shareholders who have investment policies according with the medium-to long-term 
interests of shareholders
(b) Overview
-   IHI has an Audit & Supervisory Board, which comprises five audit & supervisory board members (including three 
independent outside members) who audit the duties executed by directors. The chairperson of Audit & Supervisory Board is 
Seiji Maruyama who is a standing audit & supervisory board member. Name of each audit & supervisory board member is 
stated in “(2) Information about directors and audit & supervisory board members.”
-   The Board of Directors, which consists of 12 directors (including four independent outside directors), makes decisions 
related to all important matters concerning the management of IHI and the IHI Group, in addition to supervising directors in 
their business execution. The independent outside directors, who are elected from among individuals with extensive 
experience and broad insight as management, or with a high degree of specialist knowledge and diverse experience, 
participate in the Board of Directors’ decision-making process, offer advice and make recommendations independently of 
internal directors who have been delegated the authority to business execution. The chairperson of the Board of Directors is 
Tsugio Mitsuoka who is the chairman of the Board of IHI. Name of each director is stated in “(2) Information about 
directors and audit & supervisory board members.”
-   IHI has an executive officer system to strengthen the monitoring and supervisory functions of the board of directors over 
management and to expedite decision-making related to business execution.The executive officers are appointed by 
resolution of the Board of Directors. (There are 23 executive officers, seven of which concurrently serve as directors.) The 
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) manages the duties of the executive officers, giving directions and supervision. The 
executive officers follow the CEO’s directions to execute their assigned duties. Name of each executive officer are stated in 
“(2) Information about directors and audit & supervisory board members.”
-   The Management Committee, which consists of members appointed by the CEO, supports the CEO’s decision-making and 
business execution. In addition, IHI has established the “ESG Management Promotion Committee” and “Risk Management 
Conference” as bodies for which the CEO himself serves as the chairman. The ESG Management Promotion Committee 
aims to examine basic policies and specific measures for ESG management, and assess and improve the implementation 
status. The Risk Management Conference controls risk management of the IHI Group, discusses and approves important 
matters in relation to general risk management.
-   IHI has established the Compensation Advisory Committee, which is an optional committee for ensuring the validity and 
objectivity of director’s remuneration, and comprises six members: three independent outside directors (Yoshiyuki 
Nakanishi, Minoru Usui, Toshihiro Uchiyama) and one independent outside audit & supervisory board member (Kazuhiro 
Muto), the director in charge of human resources (Akihiro Seo), and the director in charge of finance and accounting 
(Yasuaki Fukumoto), with one independent outside director (Yoshiyuki Nakanishi) serving as the committee chairperson.
-   IHI has established the Nomination Advisory Committee, which aims to ensure that personnel affairs of directors are 
properly conducted, and comprises five members: the president and four independent outside directors (Yoshiyuki 
Nakanishi, Chieko Matsuda, Minoru Usui, Toshihiro Uchiyama), with the president serving as the committee chairperson.

- 64 -
system.
(c) Reason for adoption of corporate governance system
-   IHI adopted the corporate governance management structure shown above to optimize the auditing and overseeing of every 
aspect of corporate management while also ensuring management efficiency.
(d) Internal controls and risk management
-   The Compliance Group in Legal Division is tasked with advancing compliance activities and the Compliance Committee, 
which is subcommittee of the Risk management Conference sets and carries out Group-wide action plans for each fiscal 
year. In addition, the IHI compliance system promotes whistleblowing and training aimed at deepening the understanding of 
and compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.
-   A “Compliance Hotline” is established as a whistleblower system where the Legal Division be set as a point of contact to 
provide consultations and receive reporting in order to effectively act as a self-correcting function and prevent 
noncompliance before it occurs.
-   The Financial Instruments and Exchange Act require companies to have an internal control system that includes a body that 
has complete independence to evaluate organizational units within IHI. IHI’s Internal Audit Division, which reports directly 
to the President, is an independent body tasked with overall planning, organizing and studying of evaluations, and 
determining the effectiveness of internal controls for the entire Group. In addition, internal-control evaluation units are in 
the Finance & Accounting Division and the four Business Areas, the primary subjects of evaluations. Intelligent 
Information Management Headquarters has an IT-controls evaluation unit.
-   The IHI Group is constantly working to improve its risk management system, including mechanisms for managing and 
evaluating this system. The Risk Management Conference chaired by the CEO meets regularly to ascertain risks and 
consider key initiatives, as well as prevent risks and minimize the impact of any risk that occurs. In addition, the IHI Group 
is executing the activities of risk management activities according to each clarified role and responsibility upon risk 
management of corporate divisions, Business Area and divisions based on the “Basic Regulations of Risk Management” 
which stipulates the Group’s risk management, and quarterly reporting on the implementation status to the Board of 
Director.
-   The Basic Regulations of Crisis Management stipulate how to handle any crisis that has the potential to significantly impact 
the IHI Group. The crisis management system includes placing an executive officer in charge of crisis management, 
establishing a crisis management secretariat and formulating measures to handle any crisis. In addition, each division 
prepares a business continuity plan to prepare for possible emergencies.
-   IHI has established the Project Risk Management Division as screening and monitoring functions for large-scale project 
orders and large-scale investment projects. This division works in concert with the individual Business Areas, seeking to 
understand risks and respond promptly to them by means of communication that puts a high priority on information from on 
site.
- 65 -
-   IHI reviews large-scale project orders and large-scale investment projects that could have a significant impact on the IHI 
Group performance as follows.
(Large-scale Project Orders)
The IHI Group has established the Important Project Review Meeting and the Review Subcommittee to examine the 
required technology, resources and contractual conditions at the project examination stage, thereby enhancing our system 
for reviewing various risks that must be reflected in the cost estimations, such as technical risks including contracts and 
prototype elements before receiving orders. To maintain the profitability of projects, each Business Areas strives to 
enhance project management in terms of work processes, costs and quality, and then accurately assess profitability by 
implementing reviews by experts at each stage, including design, procurement and construction, etc.
(Large-scale Investment Projects)
The Investment Review Meeting and the Investment Review Subcommittee review the significance of the investment, the 
soundness of related plans, investment efficiency, maximum potential loss and the establishment of tollgates. Once an 
investment has been initiated, the monitoring begins, which entails confirmation that the tollgate criteria have been met 
for advancing to the next phase and tracking to confirm what degree the results deviate from the investment plan.
-   For each business, order volume is stringently controlled and risks and profitability are rigorously evaluated through regular 
meetings of the Finance & Accounting Division and managers of each Business Areas /SBU. In addition, cost operations 
are consolidated in the Finance & Accounting Division for enhanced control, and intermediate cost procedures are 
stipulated and standardized.
(e) Limited liability contract
-   In accordance with Article 427, Paragraph 1 of the Companies Act, outside directors and audit & supervisory board 
members enter into contracts with IHI to limit their liability for damages stipulated in Article 423, Paragraph 1 of the same 
act. The amount of the limitation of their liability for damages under the said contract shall be the amount stipulated by laws

supervisory board members, as provided for in Article 430-3, Paragraph 1 of the Companies Act. The insurance policy 
covers losses that may arise from the insured’s assumption of liability incurred in the course of the performance of duties as 
an officer or a person at a certain position, or receipt of the pursuit of such liability. However, there are certain reasons for 
coverage exclusion, such as cover not being extended to liability originating in behavior that was performed with the

Reason for Election
Yoshiyuki
Nakanishi
The IHI Group has business relationships 
involving the maintenance and sale of industrial 
machinery, etc. with DIC Corporation, where 
Yoshiyuki Nakanishi previously served as a 
business executive. However, the transaction 
amount that business relationship generates is 
less than 0.1% of the IHI’s consolidated revenue 
and less than 0.1% of consolidated net sales of 
DIC Corporation (for the most recent fiscal 
year), which is immaterial. Therefore, this has 
no impact on his independence.
Yoshiyuki Nakanishi following experiences in sales of products and 
services of a global chemical manufacturer and involvement in 
operations of its key business, has gained abundant experience, 
accomplishments, and extensive insight into overall corporate 
management at the helm of the manufacturer, where he implemented 
various measures to respond to changes in the business environment. 
Aiming to reflect these qualities in the management of IHI and 
expecting he can carry out management oversight and monitoring 
functions from an independent perspective. Therefore, IHI has elected 
him as an outside director.
Yoshiyuki Nakanishi does not contravene the standards for 
independence stipulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange and 
determining the independence of outside officers set forth by IHI, and 
is judged unlikely to have a conflict of interests with general 
shareholders. IHI has therefore elected him as an independent 
director.
Chieko
Matsuda
Not applicable
Chieko Matsuda has abundant experience and insight gained through 
financial and capital market operations and management consulting 
operations and an extremely high level of expertise in corporate and 
finance strategy as a researcher, as well as broad insight as an outside 
director of several companies. Aiming to reflect these qualities in the 
management of IHI and expecting she can carry out management 
oversight and monitoring functions from an independent perspective. 
Therefore, IHI has elected her as an outside director.
Chieko Matsuda does not contravene the standards for independence 
stipulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange and determining the 
independence of outside officers set forth by IHI, and is judged 
unlikely to have a conflict of interests with general shareholders. IHI 
has therefore elected her as an independent director.
(ii) Outside directors and audit & supervisory board members
 - Four outside directors and three outside audit & supervisory board members provide IHI with objective advice about its 
business and help to ensure effective auditing and oversight.
 - IHI sets up independence standards for outside directors and outside audit & supervisory board members. These standards are 
based on the requirements for independent directors/ audit & supervisory board members stipulated by the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange and their emphasis is to assure that outside directors and outside audit & supervisory board members are genuinely 
independent.
 - The outside directors and outside audit & supervisory board members are required to adhere to these same standards, including 
having no conflict of interest with any general shareholder. They are reported as independent directors/audit & supervisory 
board members to Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc where IHI is listed.
 - Attributes of independent directors/audit & supervisory board members of outside directors and outside audit & supervisory 
board members, as well as the reasons for their election, are noted below.

such sale shall be deducted. Gain on sale of real estate in “Operating profit” is defined as the sum of “Gain on 
sale of investment property” (rounded to the nearest million yen) and “ Gain on sale of property, plant and 
equipment”(rounded to the nearest million yen) shown in the notes relating to other income and expenses in the 
consolidated financial statements of IHI.
*: “Interest income” and “dividend income” are the amounts (rounded to the nearest million yen) respectively shown 
in the notes relating to finance income and finance costs in the consolidated financial statements of IHI.
*: “Total equity attributable to owners of the parent” shall be the average of the amounts shown on IHI’s 
consolidated statement of financial position for the previous fiscal year, and for the current fiscal year (they shall 
be rounded off to the nearest million yen.)
*: The amount of interest-bearing liabilities shall be the average of the total outstanding amounts of bonds and 
borrowings as of the beginning and the end of the fiscal year (respectively rounded to the nearest million yen.), 
which are shown in the notes relating to bonds and borrowings in the consolidated financial statements of IHI 
(rounded to the nearest million yen.)
[c] For newly elected directors, the “ratio obtained by dividing the months serving as the directors of IHI in the fiscal 
year 2024 by 9” shall be used for calculation. In addition, the “months serving as the directors of IHI in the fiscal 
year 2024” shall be calculated according to the calendar, with any fractions of less than one month that arise 
rounded up to one month. However, the period of service between June 26, 2024, and June 30, 2024, shall be 
discarded for calculation purposes.
[d] In the event of fractions of less than one unit of shares occurring in the number obtained from (a) to (c) above (with 
fractions of less than one point discarded; hereinafter “number of finalized points”), said fraction shall be discarded, 
after which the number shall be multiplied by 50% to calculate the number of shares to be provided.
As a result of the above, the maximum number of shares to be provided to directors of IHI shall be limited to the 
number calculated and finalized in cases where the month of service is 12 (or in cases where the month of service is 9 
for newly elected directors) and when based on the highest performance evaluation payout rate.
Notes:     1.   The number of IHI’s shares to be provided as performance-based share remuneration shall be calculated 
based on the titles and positions determined at the meeting of the Board of Directors of IHI held on June 
26, 2024. Moreover, shares shall not be provided to directors who died before the end of June 2027 (if the 
end of June is not a business day, then the directly preceding business day).
2.   Regarding directors of IHI, the number of finalized points of the director shall be zero, if the following 
reasons arise before the date when the number of finalized points are calculated (hereinafter “calculation 
date of number of finalized points”).
(1) If a director (or an audit & supervisory board member when the director assumes the position of an audit 
& supervisory board member) agrees to take office as an officer or employee with a company whose main 
business contains such business as in the business categories of the IHI Group, within three years after 
resigning the position.
(2) If a director violates laws or regulations.
(3) If a director (or an audit & supervisory board member when a director assumes the position of an audit & 
supervisory board member) violate his/her own duty of obligation for fiduciary duty or fidelity.
3.   At the 200th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 23, 2017, IHI received approval to 
contribute to the trust set up by IHI (hereinafter “the Trust”) for the purpose of providing performance-
based share remuneration, up to a maximum of ¥450 million every fiscal year. However, in cases where 
the total number of finalized points of each director is greater than the number of shares of IHI bought and 
held by the Trust ( hereinafter “number of shares held in trust”) under the upper limit, the number of shares 
held in trust shall be divided proportionately according to the number of finalized points owned by each 
director, and the obtained number shall be deemed the number of finalized points of each director, and 
then the number of shares to be provided to each director shall be calculated.
4.   In the event of IHI’s shares undergoing an event such as a share split, gratis allotment of shares, or 
consolidation of shares, etc., the number of shares to be provided shall be adjusted to reasonable levels, 
corresponding to the level of the ratio, etc. used in such events.
- 88 -
5.   Directors of IHI who receive performance-based share remuneration shall be “executive officers” as 
defined by Article 34 Paragraph 1, item 3 of the Corporation Tax Act.
6.   The “indicators on profits” of Article 34 Paragraph 1, item 3 (b) of the Corporation Tax Act shall be the 
Consolidated ROIC. The amounts of this shall be listed in the Annual Securities Report of IHI for the 
fiscal year 2026.
7.   During the period from the calculation date of number of finalized points to the end of June 2027, in the 
case that a fact (including the occurrence of errors in performance indicators and of such reasons as 
described in Note 2) is found out that the number of the finalized points (hereinafter “the modified number 
of the finalized points”) should be calculated smaller than the number of finalized points calculated on the 
calculation date of number of finalized points (hereinafter “calculated number of finalized points”), IHI 
will put it into practice as below.
(1) If the transfer of shares (hereinafter “the transfer”) has not yet been implemented at the point the above fact 
is found out, IHI shall implement the transfer with the modified number of the finalized points.
(2) If the transfer has already been implemented at the point the above fact is found out or is implemented with 
the calculated number of finalized points since it could not be stopped, the receiver of the transfer shall 
return the difference between the money and/or shares transferred according to the modified number of the 
finalized points and those transferred according to the calculated number of the finalized points back to 
IHI.
8.   In the event of fractions of less than one unit of shares occurring in the number of shares to be provided, 
said fractions shall be discarded.

3. Calculation method for the monetary amount to be provided as performance-based share remuneration
At a meeting of the Board of Directors of IHI held on June 26, 2024, it was resolved that a sum of money (hereinafter in 
this section, “the money”) determined in accordance with objective calculation methods based on indicators showing the 
profit situation (hereinafter in this section, “profit indicators”) for the fiscal year 2026 shall be provided to all of those 
directors of IHI present on June 26, 2024 (excluding outside directors), in consideration for their execution of duties in 
the fiscal year 2024. The money is treated as a part of performance-based share remuneration that is same as the 
provision of the shares mentioned above 2., and the shares and money will be provided by the amount equivalent to 
50% of the fixed points granted under the performance-based share remuneration plan, respectively. (However, for non-
resident officers, only the cash equivalent to 100% of the fixed number of points will be delivered.)
The details of the calculation method are as given below, which was resolved by the Board of Directors based on the 
report made by the Remuneration Advisory Committee whose majority is independent outside directors and audit & 
supervisory board members (all the members who are three independent outside directors and one independent outside 
audit & supervisory board member agreed with the report.). These monies are scheduled to be provided along with the 
Shares that have the same applicable period for the execution of duties, within two months (However, for non-resident 
officers, one month) of the day following the day on which is held the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders 
pertaining to the fiscal year 2026, for which the profit indicators will be finalized.
The market price of IHI’s shares shall be the closing price or quote at the Tokyo Stock Exchange on the day needed to 
calculate the market price of IHI’s shares, and in situations where there is no closing price or quote published on that 
day, the closing price or quote on the most recent day for which a closing price or quote can be obtained shall be used.
The maximum monetary amount to be provided to the directors of IHI shall be finalized corresponding to titles and 
positions as below.
*: For newly elected Directors, the maximum amount is ¥17,690 thousand.
Notes:  1.   The content of notes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 to “2. Calculation method for the number of the IHI’s shares to 
be provided as performance-based share remuneration” apply equally to “3. Calculation method for the 
monetary amount to be provided as performance-based share remuneration.”
2.   In the event that fractions of less than ¥1 occur in the monetary amount to be provided, fractions shall be 
discarded.
3.   For non-resident officers, a. will be the “Number of finalized points” and only money will be paid outside 
the framework of the Trust.

(ii) Remuneration, etc. for the current fiscal year
(a) Remuneration, etc. of directors and audit & supervisory board members and number of recipients
Notes:     1.   Remuneration of directors does not include salaries as employees of directors who are also employees.
2.   IHI has introduced a performance-based share remuneration plan [Board Benefit Trust], which pays shares 
and money after a certain period has elapsed. The total amount of performance-based share remuneration is 
the amount of the provision for share acquisition costs related to the granted points recorded by reporting 
company in the fiscal year, which may be different from the actual total payment amount.
3.   The total amount of performance-based bonus is the amount of the provision that was recorded for the current 
fiscal year, and it may be different from the total amount that is actually paid.
4.   The numbers of directors and audit & supervisory board members as of March 31, 2024, are respectively 12 
(including 4 outside directors) and 5 (including 3 outside audit & supervisory board members). The reason for 
the discrepancy from the above is that figures in the chart include 3 directors and 1 auditor who retired at the 
conclusion of the 206th Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 23, 2023.
5.   Remuneration, etc. paid to directors and corporate auditors in foreign currencies are converted into yen using 
the average rate during the period.
(b) Remuneration paid, etc. of directors and audit & supervisory board members, whose total amount paid to each position of 
directors and audit & supervisory board members, equaled or exceeded ¥100 million
Notes:   1.  The total amount of performance-based share remuneration and performance-based bonus is the amount of the 
provision that was recorded for the current fiscal year, and it may be different from the total amount that is 
actually paid.
2.  Remuneration, etc. paid to directors and corporate auditors in foreign currencies are converted into yen using 
the average rate during the period.
(c) Reason for determining remuneration, etc. for individual directors is in line with company policy
In determining matters involving remuneration of the respective directors for the fiscal year, the Remuneration Advisory 
Committee, primarily consisting of independent outside directors, took a multifaceted approach in reviewing matters that 
included alignment with the Company’s policies for determining remuneration, considering objective and specialized 
information required for deliberations. The Board of Directors respects the findings of the Remuneration Advisory 
Committee and accordingly deems them to be in alignment with policy for determining matters involving remuneration for 
the respective directors.

(5) Shareholdings
(a) Standard and concept of classification of Investment shares
Regarding investment shares held for pure investment and investment shares held for purpose other than pure investment, 
shares that aim to gain profits solely from fluctuations in the value of the shares or dividends on shares are classified into 
share held for pure investment, and shares which contribute to the growth and corporate value of IHI over the medium- to 
long-term in addition to the aim are classified into shares held for purpose other than pure investment.
(b) Investment shares held for purpose other than pure investment
[a] Method of examining holding policy and rationality and details of examination in the Board of Directors, etc. concerning 
the propriety of holding individual shares.
In principle, IHI seeks to reduce the number of cross-shareholdings after conducting a sufficient discussion with the held 
company. However, IHI may hold shares of strategic partners such as business alliances and joint research and 
development for the purpose of improving medium- to long-term growth and corporate value.
Moreover, the propriety of holding individual shares is assessed annually in the Board of Directors by confirming the 
medium- to long-term significance based on the holding policy and examining the rationality from the perspective 
whether the benefits and risks from each holding cover the cost of capital.

Notes to consolidated financial statements
1.   Reporting entity
IHI Corporation (hereinafter, “IHI”) is a stock company located in Japan and incorporated in accordance with the 
Companies Act of Japan. IHI’s consolidated financial statements consist of accounts of IHI and its subsidiaries 
(hereinafter, the “IHI Group”), as well as IHI’s interests in its associates.
The IHI Group operates four main businesses, providing a diverse range of products. The four businesses are: 
Resources, Energy and Environment; Social Infrastructure; Industrial Systems and General-Purpose Machinery; 
and Aero Engine, Space and Defense.
2.   Basis of preparation
(1)    Compliance with IFRS
The consolidated financial statements of the IHI Group are prepared in accordance with IFRS, pursuant to 
the provisions of Article 93 of the Regulation on Consolidated Financial Statements, as the IHI Group meets 
the requirements for a “specified company complying with designated international accounting standards” as 
prescribed in Article 1-2 of said Regulation.
The consolidated financial statements were approved by Hiroshi Ide, Representative Director and President, 
on June 26, 2024.
(2)    Basis of measurement
As described in Note “3. Material accounting policies,” the IHI Group’s consolidated financial statements 
have been prepared on the acquisition cost basis, except for certain financial instruments, etc. that are 
measured at fair value.
(3)    Functional currency and presentation currency
The presentation currency of the IHI Group’s consolidated financial statements is Japanese yen, which is also 
its functional currency, and figures less than one million yen are rounded off to the nearest million yen.
- 114 -
3.   Material accounting policies
(1)    Basis for consolidation
A.   Subsidiaries
A subsidiary refers to an entity controlled by the IHI Group. The IHI Group determines that it controls an 
investee entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity 
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Consolidation of a subsidiary 
begins from the acquisition date, which is the date when the IHI Group obtains control of the subsidiary, 
and ceases on the date when it loses control of the subsidiary.
If any accounting policies applied by a subsidiary differ from those applied by the IHI Group, adjustments 
are made to the subsidiary’s financial statements where needed.
The intra-group balances of receivables and payables and transactions as well as unrealized gains or losses 
arising from the intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to owners of parent and non-controlling interests even 
if this results in a negative balance in non-controlling interests.
When the account closing date of a subsidiary differs from that of IHI, the subsidiary prepares, for 
consolidation purposes, additional financial information as of the consolidated account closing date.
Any changes in ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for 
as equity transactions. The difference between the amount by which non-controlling interests are adjusted 
and the fair value of the consideration is directly recognized in equity as equity attributable to owners of 
parent. If the IHI Group loses control of a subsidiary, it recognizes the gain or loss resulting from such 
loss of control in profit or loss for the fiscal year.
- 115 -
B.   Associates and joint ventures
An associate refers to an entity over which the IHI Group has significant influence in respect of the 
operating and financial policies of the entity, but does not have control over the entity. If the IHI Group 
holds, directly or indirectly, at least 20% but not more than 50% of the voting rights of an entity, it is 
presumed that the IHI has significant influence over the entity.
A joint venture refers to a joint arrangement whereby two or more parties, including the IHI Group, that 
have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement; provided that the 
joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of the arrangement, which exists only when 
decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are measured using the equity method (hereinafter, “entities 
accounted for using the equity method”).
The consolidated financial statements include the reporting company’s share of changes in profit or loss 
and other comprehensive income of entities accounted for using the equity method from the date when the 
reporting company obtained significant influence over, or joint control of, the entities to the date when it 
loses such influence or control.
If any accounting policies adopted by entities accounted for using the equity method differ from those 
adopted by the IHI Group, adjustments are made to the financial statements of entities where needed.
In addition, the consolidated financial statements include investments in entities accounted for using the 
equity method whose account closing date differs from that of IHI because it is impracticable for those 
entities to align their account closing date with that of IHI due, for example, to relationships with other 
shareholders. The account closing date of most of those entities is December 31. Adjustments are made 
for the effects of any significant transactions or events that occurred between the account closing date of 
those entities and that of IHI.
Goodwill related to entities accounted for using the equity method is included in the carrying amount of 
investments, and is not subject to amortization. When there is an indication that an investment in an entity 
accounted for using the equity method may be impaired, the carrying amount of the entire investment 
(including goodwill) is tested for impairment as a single asset.
If the IHI Group loses significant influence over, or joint control of, an associate and a joint venture, and 
ceases to use the equity method, it recognizes gain or loss resulting from the discontinuation of the equity 
method in profit or loss for the fiscal year.
- 116 -
(2)    Business combinations
The IHI Group accounts for business combinations by applying the acquisition method. The consideration 
for acquisition is measured as the sum of the acquisition-date fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities 
assumed, and equity instruments issued by IHI in exchange for control of an acquiree.
If the aggregate amount of consideration for acquisition, the amount of non-controlling interest, and 
previously held equity interests exceeds the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities, such excess is 
recorded as goodwill in the consolidated statement of financial position. If, conversely, the consideration 
turns out to be less than the fair value, the difference is immediately recorded as bargain purchase gain in the 
consolidated statement of profit or loss. If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by 
the end of the period in which the combination occurs, the items for which the accounting is incomplete are 
measured at provisional amounts, and subsequently adjusts the provisional amounts during the measurement 
period, which is one year from the acquisition date.
Goodwill is presented at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not subject to 
amortization, but an impairment test for goodwill is performed in each fiscal year, mainly in the fourth 
quarter, and impairment losses are recorded when necessary. Impairment losses of goodwill are not reversed.
Acquisition-related costs incurred in connection with business combination are expensed as incurred. 
Acquisition of additional non-controlling interests after control is obtained is accounted for as an equity 
transaction and no goodwill arising from such a transaction is recognized.
For a business combination achieved in stages, the IHI Group remeasures its previously held equity interest 
in the acquiree at fair value as of the date of obtaining control and recognizes the resulting gains or losses in 
profit or loss, or other comprehensive income.
(3)    Foreign currency translation
A.   Translation of transactions denominated in foreign currency
Transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated into the functional currencies of the IHI 
Group and its associates using the spot exchange rate at the dates of the transactions or rates that 
approximate such rates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
into the functional currencies at the spot exchange rates at the consolidated account closing date. 
Exchange differences arising from the translation and settlement are recognized in profit or loss.
B.   Translation of the financial statements of foreign operations
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Japanese yen using the spot exchange rates 
at the account closing date, whereas revenue and expenses of foreign operations are translated into 
Japanese yen using the average exchange rate during the period. Exchange differences arising from such 
translation are recognized in other comprehensive income. On the disposal of a foreign operation, the 
cumulative amount of the exchange differences relating to that foreign operation are recognized in profit 
or loss for the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of.
- 117 -
(4)    Financial instruments
A.  Financial assets
a.        Initial recognition and measurement
The IHI Group recognizes financial assets on the transaction date when it becomes a party to the 
contract for the financial assets.
Financial assets are classified into those measured at fair value and those measured at amortized cost.
Financial assets are classified into those measured at amortized cost if they meet both of the 
following conditions. Financial assets other than the above are classified into those measured at fair 
value.
-   The assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to
collect contractual cash flows; and
-   The contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
For financial assets measured at fair value, except for equity instruments held for trading, which must 
be measured at fair value through profit or loss, the IHI Group designates, for each financial 
instrument, whether the instrument is measured at fair value through profit or loss or the instrument 
is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and consistently applies the same 
designation. The IHI Group decides on such classification at the initial recognition.
All financial assets are measured at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the 
financial assets unless they are classified into those measured at fair value through profit or loss.
b.        Subsequent measurement
After the initial recognition, financial assets are measured as follows, depending on respective 
classifications:
(i)     Financial assets measured at amortized cost
They are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
(ii)    Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss
After the initial recognition, they are measured at fair value, and changes in the fair value are 
recognized in profit or loss.
(iii)   Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
Changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income. If such financial assets are 
derecognized or the fair value decreased significantly, such changes are transferred to retained 
earnings. Dividends from such financial assets are recognized in profit or loss for the fiscal year.
- 118 -
c.        Impairment losses of financial assets
The IHI Group recognizes allowance for doubtful accounts for expected credit losses on financial 
assets measured at amortized cost.
The IHI Group determines, at the end of each reporting period, whether credit risk of the assets has 
increased significantly since the initial recognition. If the credit risk has increased significantly, 
allowance for doubtful accounts is recognized at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. 
If no significant increase in the credit risk is identified, allowance for doubtful accounts is recognized 
at an amount equal to expected credit losses for 12 months.
However, for trade receivables and contract assets, allowance for doubtful accounts is recognized at 
an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses, regardless of whether or not the credit risk has 
increased significantly since the initial recognition.
Objective evidence indicating a significant increase in credit risk includes default or delinquency by 
a debtor, extension of the due date of receivables on terms that the IHI Group would not otherwise 
grant, and indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy. Provision for, or reversal of, 
allowance for doubtful accounts for expected credit losses is recognized in profit or loss.
d.        Derecognition
The IHI Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the 
financial asset expire, or when it transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the 
financial asset and also transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the 
financial asset.
B.  Financial liabilities
a.        Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities, except for financial guarantee contracts, are classified as those measured at 
amortized cost.
At initial recognition, financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are measured at fair value less 
transaction costs.
b.        Subsequent measurement
After the initial recognition, financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are measured using the 
effective interest method.
After the initial recognition, financial guarantee contracts are measured at the higher of:
-   the best estimate of expenditures required to settle obligations as of the account closing date; and
-   the amount initially recognized less accumulated amortization.
c.        Derecognition
The IHI Group derecognizes a financial liability when it is extinguished—i.e. when the obligation 
specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
d.        Revenue-sharing arrangements
In the Civil aero engines Business, IHI has entered into revenue-sharing arrangements mainly with 
financial institutions, and classifies these arrangements into financial liabilities measured at 
amortized cost. Under these arrangements, IHI receives funding to execute certain business projects 
and makes payments based on future earnings of the projects.
At the initial recognition, IHI measures such financial liabilities measured at amortized cost at the 
amount of the funds received. After the initial recognition, IHI applies the effective interest method 
using a discount rate equal to the rate of return estimated upon entering into the arrangement. 
Furthermore, the number of engines to be delivered in the future etc. are not taken into consideration 
when measuring at amortized cost.
- 119 -
C.   Derivatives and hedge accounting
The IHI Group uses derivatives, including forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts, to 
hedge foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
These derivatives are initially recognized at fair value. Even after the initial recognition, they are 
measured at fair value with subsequent changes in the fair value being recognized in profit or loss unless 
they are designated as a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge.
At the inception of the hedge, the IHI Group formally designates and documents the hedging relationship 
for which the hedge accounting is applied and its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking 
the hedge. That documentation includes identification of the specific hedging instrument, the hedged item, 
the nature of the risk being hedged and the method of assessing the hedge effectiveness. In addition, the 
IHI Group assesses on an ongoing basis whether the hedging relationship is prospectively effective.
Hedges that qualify for the hedge accounting are classified and accounted for as follows:
a.        Fair value hedges
A fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset or 
liability or an unrecognized firm commitment. The IHI Group recognizes, in profit or loss, any 
changes in fair value of the recognized asset or liability or the unrecognized firm commitment and 
related derivatives.
b.        Cash flow hedges
A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a 
forecast transaction or a recognized asset or liability. As long as the hedge is highly effective, 
changes in fair value of the effective portion of the derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are 
recognized in other comprehensive income, whereas changes in fair value of the ineffective portion 
thereof are recognized in profit or loss.
D.   Offsetting a financial asset and a financial liability
A financial asset and a financial liability are offset with the net amount presented in the consolidated 
statement of financial position when, and only when the IHI Group currently has a legally enforceable 
right to set off the recognized amounts, and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset 
and settle the liability simultaneously.
(5)    Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term investments with 
maturities not exceeding three months from the acquisition date, that are readily convertible into cash and 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
(6)    Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories comprises all 
costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present 
location and condition. The costs of conversion include fixed production overheads based on the normal 
capacity level. In determining the cost of inventories, finished goods and work in process are determined 
principally by the specific identification method, whereas raw materials and supplies are determined 
principally by the moving average method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
- 120 -
(7)    Property, plant and equipment
As the IHI Group uses the cost model to measure property, plant and equipment, an item of property, plant 
and equipment is carried at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment 
losses.
The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment includes any costs directly attributable to acquiring the 
item, the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization, the costs of dismantling and removing the item and the 
restoration costs.
Except for non-depreciable assets such as land, each asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its 
estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives of major items of property, plant and equipment are as 
follows:
-   Buildings and structures:               2 to 75 years
-   Machinery and vehicles:                2 to 17 years
-   Tools, furniture and fixtures:         2 to 20 years
The estimated useful life and depreciation method etc. are subject to review at the end of each fiscal year, 
and any changes to them are prospectively applied as a change in an accounting estimate.
(8)    Intangible assets
As the IHI Group uses the cost model to measure intangible assets, an intangible asset is carried at its cost 
less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses.
A separately acquired intangible asset is measured initially at cost, which includes borrowing costs that 
should be capitalized. The cost of intangible assets acquired through business combinations is measured at 
fair value at the acquisition date. For internally generated intangible assets, all expenditures, except for 
development expenditure eligible for capitalization, are recorded as expenses for the period in which they are 
incurred. The cost of an internally generated intangible asset eligible for capitalization is the sum of 
expenditures incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the criteria for capitalization.
Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life 
and tested for impairment whenever there is an indication of impairment. The estimated useful life and 
amortization method for intangible assets with a finite useful life are subject to review at the end of each 
fiscal year, and any changes to them are prospectively applied as a change in an accounting estimate.
The estimated useful lives of major intangible assets with a finite useful life are as follows:
-   Software:                                        5 years
-   Capitalized development costs:     Life cycle of product models under development (25 years)
-   Patents:                                          Contract period or 8 years
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and those yet to be available for use are not amortized and are 
tested for impairment individually or by cash-generating unit in each fiscal year or whenever there is an 
indication of impairment.
- 121 -
(9)    Leases
A.   Lessee
The IHI Group recognizes a right-of-use asset, which represents its right to use an underlying asset, and a 
lease liability, which represents its obligation to pay lease payments. It also recognizes expenses 
associated with leases as depreciation charge for the right-of-use asset and interest expense on the lease 
liability. For short-term leases, which are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less, and leases for 
which the underlying asset is of low value, the IHI Group recognizes the lease payments associated with 
those leases in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
As the IHI Group uses the cost model to measure a right-of-use asset, a right-of-use asset is carried at cost 
at the commencement date less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
The cost of the right-of-use asset is measured at the amount of the initial measurement of the lease 
liability, adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct 
costs incurred, the costs of dismantling and removing the underlying asset and the restoration costs under 
the lease contract. Each right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis from the commencement 
date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. Any 
change in the useful life or the lease term is treated as a change in an accounting estimate and accounted 
for prospectively.
The lease liability is measured and presented at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at 
the commencement date. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or 
the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. Interest expense on the lease liability in each period during the 
lease term is the amount that produces constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the 
lease liability. The interest expense is recognized in profit or loss over the lease term and included in 
“Finance costs.”
B.   Lessor
The IHI Group classifies a lease of property, plant and equipment as a finance lease if it transfers 
substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset to a lessee. Under the 
finance lease, the lessor derecognizes the underlying asset, but instead recognizes and measures the net 
investment in the lease at the present value of the total lease payments.
A lease of property, plant and equipment is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset to the lessee. Under 
the operating lease, the lessor continues to recognize the underlying asset, and also recognizes the lease 
income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
(10)   Investment property
Investment property is real estate property held to earn rent income, or capital gains, or both. Investment 
property does not include real estate property for sale in the ordinary course of business, nor does it include 
real estate property for use in the production or sale of goods or services or for other administrative purposes.
As the IHI Group uses the cost model to measure investment property after the initial recognition, investment 
property is carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. The 
cost of investment property includes any costs directly attributable to acquiring the asset, the borrowing costs 
eligible for capitalization, the costs of dismantling and removing the asset and the restoration costs.
Investment property is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 2 to 50 years. The 
estimated useful life and depreciation method etc. are subject to review at the end of each fiscal year, and any 
changes to them are prospectively applied as a change in an accounting estimate.
- 122 -
(11)   Impairment of non-financial assets
The IHI Group determines, at the account closing date, whether there is any indication of impairment of non-
financial assets excluding inventories and deferred tax assets. If any such indication exists, the IHI Group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. Goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and 
intangible assets yet to be available for use are tested for impairment in each fiscal year, mainly in the fourth 
quarter, irrespective of whether there is any indication that they may be impaired. When the recoverable 
amount of an individual asset cannot be estimated, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to 
which the asset belongs is estimated.
The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is determined at the higher of its fair value less 
costs of disposal and its value in use. When the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds 
its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized, and the carrying amount of the asset or cash-
generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. In determining the value in use, estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to the present value using the pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessment of the time value of money, the risks specific to the asset, etc. In determining the fair value less 
costs of disposal, the IHI Group uses an appropriate valuation model supported by available indicators of the 
fair value.
The IHI Group determines, at the account closing date, whether there is any indication that an impairment 
loss recognized in prior periods for an asset other than goodwill may have decreased or may no longer exist. 
Such indications include a change in assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of the asset. If 
any such indication exists, the IHI Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset or cash-generating 
unit. When the recoverable amount of the asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its carrying amount, the 
impairment loss is reversed to the extent of the lower of the estimated recoverable amount and the carrying 
amount less depreciation or amortization that would have been recognized had no impairment losses been 
recognized in prior periods.
(12)   Provisions
The IHI Group recognizes a provision when it has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a 
past event; it is probable that the IHI Group will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate 
can be made of the amount of the obligation.
When the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of a provision is measured at the present 
value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. In determining the present value, 
the IHI Group uses a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the liability.

(13)   Employee benefits
A.   Post-employment benefit plans
a.        Defined benefit plans
Defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. 
Defined benefit obligations are separately accounted for each plan. The amount of each obligation is 
determined by estimating the amount of the future benefit that employees have earned in return for 
their service in the current and prior periods, and discounting the estimated amount to the present 
value using the projected unit credit method. The fair value of any plan assets is deducted from the 
above-determined present value of the defined benefit obligations.
The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the account closing date on high 
quality corporate bonds with the terms being almost the same as those of the defined benefit 
obligations of the IHI Group.
The IHI Group recognizes changes in the obligations as a result of the remeasurement of the benefit 
obligations and plan assets of the defined benefit plans in other comprehensive income, and 
immediately transfers them to retained earnings.
Past service cost is recognized in profit or loss for the period in which it is incurred.
b.        Defined contribution plans
Defined contribution plans are post-employment benefit plans under which an employer pays fixed 
contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further 
contributions. Contribution obligations under the defined contribution plans are recognized as 
expenses for the period in which employees render the related service.
B.   Short-term employee benefits
The IHI Group recognizes undiscounted amounts of short-term employee benefits and paid annual leave 
as expenses at the time when the related services are rendered.
When the IHI Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay bonuses in return for services 
that the employees have rendered in the past, and can make a reliable estimate of their amount, it 
recognizes the amount that can be expected to be paid under the relevant bonus plan as a liability.
- 124 -
(14)   Share-based payment
IHI operates a share-based compensation-type stock option plan and performance-based share remuneration 
plan for its directors and executive officers as share-based payment plans.
All share-based compensation-type stock options are equity-settled share-based payments.
Of performance-based share remuneration, IHI’s shares to be delivered are equity-settled share-based 
payments, and cash to be paid by reference to the market price of IHI’s shares is cash-settled share-based 
payments.
For equity-settled share-based payment transactions, the IHI Group measures the services that directors and 
executive officers rendered during the fiscal year in which the right to receive the remuneration was granted 
to them by reference to the fair value of stock options and shares of IHI to be delivered as of the grant date. 
The rendering of services determined above is recognized as an expense, and the same amount of the 
expense is recognized as an increase in equity.
For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the IHI Group measures the services that directors and 
executive officers rendered during the term in which the right to receive the remuneration was granted to 
them by reference to the stock price of IHI’s share at the account closing date. The rendering of services 
determined above is recognized as an expense, and the same amount of the expense is recognized as an 
increase in a liability. Until the liability is settled, the IHI Group measures any changes in fair value of the 
liability by reference to changes in IHI’s share price at the account closing date, and also recognizes the 
changes as an expense.
- 125 -
(15)   Revenue
The IHI Group recognizes revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the IHI Group 
expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of goods or services to customers based on the following 
five-step approach, except for interest and dividend income, etc. under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.
Step 1:          Identify the contract(s)with a customer.
Step 2:          Identify the performance obligations in the contract.
Step 3:          Determine the transaction price.
Step 4:          Allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract.
Step 5:          Recognize revenue when (or as) the IHI Group satisfies a performance obligation.
The IHI Group identifies the contract based on its substance and may combine two or more contracts. If two 
or more performance obligations are identified in the contract, the IHI Group allocate the transaction price, 
which appropriately reflects variable consideration, consideration payable to a customer, etc., to each of the 
identified performance obligations on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. The transaction price does not 
include a significant financing component.
The IHI Group recognizes as an asset the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer and the 
costs directly related to fulfilling a contract to the extent that it expects to recover those costs. The asset 
recognized above is amortized in a manner that is consistent with the method used to recognize revenue from 
the products and services to which the asset relates.
Assuming that persuasive evidence supporting a transaction exists, the IHI Group recognizes revenue when it 
is certain that economic benefits will flow to the IHI Group and those benefits can be measured reliably. 
Revenues from sale of goods, provision of services, construction contracts, etc. are measured at fair value of 
consideration received or receivable.
The recognition criteria by major revenue classification are as follows:
A.   Sale of goods
For revenue from sale of goods, the IHI Group determines that its performance obligations are satisfied 
primarily when a customer obtains control of the goods upon delivery. Hence, revenue from sale of goods 
is usually recognized upon the delivery of goods.
B.   Provision of services and construction contracts
For revenue from provision of services and construction contracts, in which performance obligations are 
satisfied over time, the IHI Group recognizes revenue by measuring progress towards complete 
satisfaction of the performance obligations. Measurements are based on the ratio of the costs incurred to 
satisfy the performance obligations against the total expected costs to fully satisfy the contractual 
obligations. Revenue is recognized by the cost recovery method when it is not possible to reasonably 
estimate progress towards satisfaction of performance obligations, but it is probable that the costs incurred 
will be recovered.
(16)   Finance income and finance costs
Finance income and finance costs consist of interest income, dividend income, interest expenses, foreign 
exchange gains or losses, and changes in the fair value of financial instruments measured at fair value 
through profit or loss. Interest income and interest expenses are recognized as incurred using the effective 
interest method. Dividend income is recognized when the IHI Group receives the dividend.
- 126 -
(17)   Government grants
Government grants are recognized at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the IHI Group will 
comply with the conditions attaching to them, and that the grants will be received.
If government grants relate to items of expense, the government grants are recognized as revenue on a 
systematic basis over the periods in which the IHI Group recognizes the related costs for which the grants are 
intended to compensate as an expense. Grants related to assets are accounted for by deducting the amount of 
the grant from the acquisition cost of the asset.
(18)   Income taxes
“Income tax expense” in the consolidated statement of profit or loss is presented as the sum of current tax 
expense and deferred tax expense.
The IHI Group measures current tax expense at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from taxation 
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws to be used to determine the amount of taxes are those that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the account closing date. The IHI Group recognizes current tax expense 
in profit or loss, except for taxes arising from other comprehensive income and those arising from business 
combinations.
The IHI Group determines deferred tax expense based on temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and the related amounts for tax purposes at the 
account closing date, unused tax credits carryforward and unused tax losses carryforward. Deferred tax assets 
are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary difference, unused tax credits carryforward, and unused tax losses carryforward can be 
recovered. Deferred tax liabilities are, in principle, recognized for taxable temporary differences.
The IHI Group does not recognize deferred tax assets or liabilities for the following temporary differences:
-   temporary difference arising from the initial recognition of goodwill;
-   temporary difference arising from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is 
not a business combination; at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable 
profit (tax loss); and at the time of the transaction, does not give rise to an equal amount of taxable 
temporary differences and deductible temporary difference;
-   deductible temporary difference associated with its investments in subsidiaries and associates, and its 
interests in joint arrangements if it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future, or if it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
temporary difference can be utilized; and
-   taxable temporary difference associated with its investments in subsidiaries and associates, and its 
interests in joint arrangements if the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled, 
and if it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when 
the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the end of the account closing date.
For uncertain tax position on income taxes, the IHI Group recognizes a reasonably estimated amount as an 
asset or a liability when it is probable that the tax position will be sustained in accordance with the 
interpretation of tax laws.
IHI and its wholly owned subsidiaries in Japan have adopted the group tax sharing system.
- 127 -
(19)   Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit attributable to owners of parent by the weighted-
average number of ordinary shares issued and outstanding, adjusted for the number of treasury shares for the 
period concerned.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated, adjusted for the effect of all dilutive potential shares.
(Changes in presentation)
(Concolidated statement of financial position)
“Refund liabilities,” which was included in “Other current liabilities” under “Current liabilities” in the 
previous consolidated fiscal year, is presented as a separate item from the current consolidated fiscal year due 
to its increased importance in terms of amount.
As a result, ¥38,642 million presented in “Other current liabilities” under “Current liabilities” in the previous 
consolidated fiscal year has been reclassified as “Refund liabilities.”
(Concolidated statement of cash flows)
“Increase (decrease) in refund liabilities,” which was included in “Other” under “Cash flows from operating 
activities” in the previous consolidated fiscal year, is presented as a separate item from the current 
consolidated fiscal year due to its increased importance in terms of amount.
As a result, ¥5,004 million presented in “Other” under “Cash flows from operating activities” in the previous 
consolidated fiscal year has been reclassified as “Increase (decrease) in refund liabilities.”

4.   Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
In preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, the management is required to make 
judgements, estimates, and assumptions that affect the adoption of accounting policies and the amounts of assets, 
liabilities, revenues, and expenses. The IHI Group uses rational methods to make such judgements and estimates, 
but estimates are inherently subject to uncertainties, and those uncertainties may influence the IHI Group’s 
operating results and financial position as recognized in future.
The estimates and their underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The effects of revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised and in future periods.
Judgements used in the process of applying the IHI Group’s accounting policies that have a significant effect on the 
amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements are as follows:
-   Items concerning financial instruments (Note “3. Material accounting policies, (4) Financial instruments,” Note 
“10. Other financial assets,” Note “21. Other financial liabilities,” and Note “36. Financial instruments”)
-   Recognition of revenue (Note “3. Material accounting policies, (15) Revenue” and Note “28. Revenue”)
Assumptions and estimates that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities within the next fiscal year are as follows:
-  Recognition of revenue and refund liabilities based on estimates
In the Civil aero engines Business, revenue decreased ¥155,973 million due to additional inspection program for 
shipped PW1100G-JM engines that occurred in the second quarter ended September 30, 2023, and refund 
liabilities was also recorded for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.
With an increase in the number of shop visits over the next few years, and an average of 350 aircraft expected to 
be grounded between 2024 and 2026, IHI, which holds approximately 15% share in the aforementioned engine 
program, expects to incur costs related to such as compensation and additional maintenance.
The reason for the increase in the number of shop visits is that at Pratt & Whitney (“P&W”), a partner company 
in the PW1100G-JM engines program, it was discovered that there were quality issues rarely in the 
manufacturing process of powder metallurgy parts (*) manufactured in the past, and as a result of P&W’s 
technical review, a policy of repeat inspections and shortening the service life was issued for parts in question in 
September 2023. Approximately 3,000 engines are affected, repeat inspections at certain cycle intervals and parts 
replacement are required. These result in an increase in the number of shop visits. The period from engine 
removal to installation is expected to be 250 to 300 days.
Effective countermeasures have already been taken for the manufacturing process, and no similar issues have 
occurred with parts other than those currently known to be affected.
(*) Powder metallurgy: A technology to produce manufacture parts by spraying molten metal and solidifying and 
forging the metal powder.

-  Recoverability of deferred tax assets (Note “3. Material accounting policies, (18) Income taxes” and Note “18. 
Income taxes”)
The IHI Group recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences, etc. can be utilized. In determining the probability that 
taxable profit will be available, the IHI Group estimates the timing and the amount of the taxable profit based on 
the business plan.
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, the IHI Group has made estimates for taxable income for the fiscal year

ending March 31, 2025, and subsequent fiscal years by considering the assumption regarding additional 
inspection program for shipped PW1100G-JM engines in the Civil aero engines Business as well as the effects of 
various investments to realize transformation, measures for the expansion of the lifecycle businesses and the 
strengthening of earnings foundations set forth in the “Group Management Policies 2023.”
Although these estimates are management’s best estimates, the actual results may differ as a result of changes in 
uncertain future economic environment, and may affect the estimate on future taxable income and judgement on 
the recoverability, etc. of deferred tax assets. At present, there have been no significant changes in the judgement 
on the recoverability, etc. of deferred tax assets from the previous fiscal year.
(Millions of yen)
(Changes in accounting estimates)
For the payment to customers for sales promotion in some of the civil aero engines programs in which IHI 
participates that have entered the investment payback phase, IHI has changed its estimation method based on the 
most recent payment status, considering the recent changes in the burden and timing of payment, effective from the 
third quarter ended December 31, 2023.
As a result, revenue increased ¥8,531 million, and operating loss and loss before tax decreased ¥8,531 million for 
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.

6.   Segment information
(1)    Overview of reportable segment
The business segments are constituent units of the IHI Group for which separate financial information is 
available. The Board of Directors periodically examines these segments for the purpose of deciding the 
allocation of management resources and evaluating operating performance.
The IHI Group organizes SBUs by products and services and allocates Business Areas to control these 
SBUs. Each Business Area manages and supervises the SBUs’ execution of business strategies and allocates 
management resources necessary for execution of the SBUs’ business strategies. SBUs shall be the units 
possessing complete business processes including sales, developments, designs, productions, constructions, 
services, etc. based on the visions and strategies drawn up by Business Areas. Each SBU is an organization 
executing business and responsible for ensuring a profit in the SBU.
Based on the above, the IHI Group consists of segments by these Business Areas and sets the Business Areas 
of “Resources, Energy and Environment,” “Social Infrastructure,” “Industrial Systems and General-Purpose 
Machinery,” and “Aero Engine, Space and Defense” as its reportable segment. There are no aggregated 
business segments when deciding the reportable segment. From the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, the 
name of the previous reportable segment of “Social Infrastructure and Offshore Facilities” has been changed 
to “Social Infrastructure”.
Main businesses, products and services belonging to each segment are as follows:

The fair value of investment property is based on an appraisal performed by an external real estate appraiser 
and other valuations. The appraisal is based on market evidence that reflects the transaction prices of 
comparable assets in accordance with the appraisal criteria of the country in which the real estate property is 
located.
The fair value of investment property is classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy because it is

16.   Impairment of non-financial assets
(1)    Impairment losses
In determining impairment losses, the IHI Group groups assets based on the smallest identifiable group of 
assets that generates largely independent cash inflows.
The breakdown of impairment losses by class of assets is as follows:
The impairment losses recognized for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 are primarily the reductions in 
the carrying amounts of Right-of-use assets and other assets to the recoverable amounts due to the 
implementation of business restructuring at IHI Charging Systems International GmbH in the Industrial 
Systems and General-Purpose Machinery segment, and the decrease of ¥3,117 million was recognized as an 
impairment loss. Such recoverable amounts were based on the value in use, whose value in use was 
calculated by discounting the estimated cash flows based on the business plan and the remaining economic 
life to present value using the discount rate based on the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of the cash-
generating units or groups of cash-generating units.
Please refer to Note “6. Segment information” for the breakdown of impairment losses by segment.

(2)    Impairment test for goodwill
The total amounts of goodwill of the IHI Group are ¥6,486 million and ¥6,338 million as of March 31, 2023 
and March 31, 2024, respectively.
Goodwill arising in a business combination was allocated to the cash-generating units expected to benefit 
from the business combination at the acquisition date. The breakdown of the carrying amounts of major 
goodwill by cash-generating unit is as follows:
Breakdown of the carrying amounts of major goodwill by cash-generating unit
The IHI Group performs a test for impairment of goodwill in each fiscal year, mainly in the fourth quarter. 
The recoverable amount in impairment test is determined based on value in use.
Value in use is calculated by discounting the estimated cash flows for up to five years, reflecting past 
experience and external information and based on the business plan and growth rate for the next three fiscal 
years approved by the management to the present value using the discount rate of 7.2 to 15.9% (7.2 to 16.8% 
as of March 31, 2023) based on the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of the cash-generating units or 
groups of cash-generating units. For the terms beyond the periods subject to the business plans, the going 
concern value is used as the value in use. The growth rate is zero for both the fiscal years ended March 31, 
2023 and 2024.
The amount of impairment losses of goodwill recognized as a result of an impairment test performed
during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 is included in “Other expenses” in the consolidated
statement of profit or loss. This was due to a reduction in the book value to the recoverable amount because 
of a decline in profitability in Industrial Systems and General-Purpose Machinery.
The main assumptions used for the impairment test are the discount rate and the growth rate. If changes 
occur to the main assumptions used for the impairment test, there is a risk that additional impairment may 
occur. However, the recoverable amount adequately exceeded the carrying amount as of March 31, 2024, 
therefore, even if the discount rate and the growth rate used for the impairment test change to the extent that 
is reasonably foreseeable, it is deemed that the recoverable amount is unlikely to be less than the carrying 
amount.

for which deferred tax liabilities are not recognized as of March 31, 2023 and 2024 were ¥34,558 million 
and ¥33,309 million, respectively. The deferred tax liabilities are not recognized because the IHI Group 
can control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that the temporary 
differences will not reverse within the foreseeable period.
(2)    Income tax expense
The breakdown of income tax expense is as follows:
(3)    Reconciliation of effective tax rate
Reconciliation between the statutory tax rate and the average effective tax rate is as follows:
The IHI Group is subject to corporation tax, inhabitant tax, and business tax. The IHI Group’s statutory 
effective tax rates calculated based on these taxes for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and 2024 are 
both 30.6%. Overseas consolidated subsidiaries, however, are subject to local corporate and other taxes.
(4)    Global minimum tax system
The IHI Group has applied the standard “International Tax Reform -Pillar Two Model Rules-” (an 
amendment of IAS 12 “Income Taxes”) effective from the current consolidated fiscal year. The amendments 
clarify that IAS 12 applies to income taxes arising from tax laws enacted or substantively enacted to 
implement the Pillar Two GloBE (Global Anti-Base Erosion) Rules of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting 
(BEPS) published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (hereinafter, 
“global minimum tax”). However, the amendments introduce a temporary exception from recognizing and 
disclosing deferred tax assets and liabilities for income taxes arising from global minimum taxes.
The IHI Group has applied the exception mentioned above and does not recognize or disclose deferred tax 
assets and liabilities for income taxes arising from global minimum taxes.
The Pillar Two Model Rules have been established in certain jurisdictions in which the IHI Group operates. 
- 150 -
This legislation will be applied from the beginning of the IHI Group's next fiscal year.
Based on an assessment of the potential impact of the application of the global minimum tax system based on 
the most recent tax returns, country-by-country reports, and financial statements of each of the component 
entities subject to the system, the IHI located in Japan will be additionally taxed (top-up tax) until the tax 
burden in light-tax countries where some subsidiaries are located reaches the minimum tax rate (15%), but 
the impact is not expected to be material.

Information about leases for which the IHI Group is a lessee is presented below.
The IHI Group has been leasing assets including buildings, mainly office buildings, and land where offices are 
located and machinery used in production facilities for business purposes under the lease contracts.
Many of the IHI Group’s real estate leases include extension and termination options in their contract terms and 
conditions to respond to the risk of price fluctuations. The IHI Group determines whether it is reasonably certain to 
exercise extension and termination options by comprehensively taking into account various factors, such as 
specifications of the leased property and business strategies.

The carrying amounts, depreciation, and amount of increase of right-of-use assets by class of underlying 
assets are as follows:

earnings of the projects. At the initial recognition, IHI measures the financial liabilities at the amount of the funds 
received. After the initial recognition, IHI applies the effective interest method using a discount rate equal to the rate of 
return estimated upon entering into the arrangement.

23.   Employee benefits
To provide retirement benefits to employees, the IHI Group has lump-sum retirement payment plans, defined 
benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans.
The lump-sum retirement payment plans provide a lump-sum payment to retirees, and IHI and certain subsidiaries 
have an obligation to pay benefits directly to retirees.
Each company funds the defined benefit pension plans by periodically making contributions to entrusted financial 
institutions. The entrusted financial institutions provide pension benefits from the reserve funds when qualified 
employees retire.
The defined contribution plans require employees who elect to participate in the plans and companies that are 
employers of such employees to make contributions over a participation period, and plan participants themselves 
are responsible for the management of plan assets. Benefits are paid by the trustee.
As the defined benefit obligations are measured based on actuarial assumptions, they are exposed to the risk of 
fluctuating assumptions, such as discount rates.
Plan assets are composed primarily of marketable shares and cash, which are exposed to the risk of fluctuating 
stock prices. However, the IHI Group considers that the risk is immaterial.

The breakdown of plan assets by major category is as follows:
A major component of the IHI Group’s plan assets is a retirement benefit trust set up for the lump-sum 
retirement payment plan. The trust is largely made up of cross-shareholdings. With respect to cross-
shareholdings, the propriety of holding individual shares is assessed in the Board of Directors every year 
by confirming the medium- to long-term significance based on the holding policy and examining the 
economic rationality from the perspective whether the benefits and risks from each holding cover the cost 
of capital.

C.     Breakdown by region
The IHI Group consists of segments by Business Area and sets the Business Areas of Resources, Energy and 
Environment; Social Infrastructure; Industrial Systems and General-Purpose Machinery; and Aero Engine, 
Space and Defense, and is engaged in the sale of goods, execution of construction and rendering of services 
in each Business Area.
The primary method to record revenue for each segment is as follows:
-   Resources, Energy and Environment and Social Infrastructure
For revenue from sale of goods, the IHI Group determines that performance obligations have been satisfied 
when customers obtain control of the goods upon its delivery. Hence, revenue from sale of goods is usually 
recognized upon the delivery of goods.
With regard to the execution of construction contracts and rendering of services including maintenance 
services, the IHI Group determines that performance obligations are satisfied over time, and revenue is 
recognized as progress towards satisfaction of the provision of performance obligations to customers is 
measured.
The progress is measured in a way that reflects the satisfaction of performance obligations, and 
measurements are estimated based on the ratio of the costs incurred to satisfy the performance obligations 
against the total expected costs to fully satisfy the performance obligations.
Revenue is recognized by the cost recovery method when it is not possible to reasonably estimate progress 
towards satisfaction of performance obligations, but it is probable that the costs incurred will be recovered.
-   Industrial Systems and General-Purpose Machinery and Aero Engine, Space and Defense
In the sale of goods mainly in the Civil aero engines Business and the Vehicular turbochargers Business, the 
IHI Group determines that performance obligations have been satisfied when customers obtain control of the 
goods upon its delivery. Hence, revenue from sale of goods is usually recognized upon the delivery of goods.
In the Civil aero engines Business, revenue decreased after estimating the costs to be borne in connection 
with the civil aero engine programs in which IHI participates, which are deducted revenue as consideration 
paid to customers.
Furthermore, “Revenue” decreased during reversal as consideration prepaid by customers was recorded in 
“Other non-current assets”.

When certain refund obligations to customers are expected to arise, such as compensation for damages 
incurred in association with performance of contracts, the IHI Group reduces revenue to the extent of the 
estimated refund liability.
The consideration of a transaction is generally received based on the progress for each performance 
obligation satisfied over time, such as a milestone in the case of a construction contract. The consideration 
for the sale of goods or rendering of services is mostly received within one year after the performance 
obligation is satisfied.
In either case, the contract does not include a significant financing component.
Further, IHI provides warranties assuring that a product satisfies specifications as provided in the contract. 
However, IHI does not identify this warranty as a separate performance obligation because it does not 
provide a distinct service.
(*1) (*2) Due to the additional inspection program for shipped PW1100G-JM engines, IHI was required to share the costs 
related to aircraft on the ground as well as the direct costs of engine maintenance in participation share of the engine program. 
In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, IHI has made the estimates based on currently available information and reduced the 
revenue by ¥ 155,973 million as the consideration to be paid to customers under the maintenance contracts. The details of the 
event are described in “Financial information，Notes to condensed quarterly consolidated financial statements，4. Significant 
accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions.”
(2)    Contract balances
The breakdown of receivables arising from contracts with customers and contract assets and liabilities is as 
follows:
The amounts of revenue recognized in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and 2024 that were included in 
the beginning balance of contract liabilities are ¥136,603 million and ¥112,164 million, respectively.
All revenues recognized for performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in the previous periods 
are immaterial.
The contract assets relate to consideration for work completed but not billed at the account closing date. The 
contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional.
The contract liabilities primarily relate to the advances received from customers.

During the second quarter ended September 30, 2023, IHI’s consolidated subsidiary, IHI E&C International 
Corporation (“IHI E&C”), reversed ¥ 15,694 million of contract assets and reduced revenue by ¥ 14,685 
million.
This arose from construction delays in the North American process plant (*1) that IHI E&C in respect of 
orders from by Elba Liquefaction Company, L.L.C. and Southern LNG Company, L.L.C. (“Customer 
Group”) in 2016. The IHI Group recognized that the delay was caused by the Customer Group circumstances 
and had continued negotiations enlisting the perspective that additional costs incurred due to the delay could 
be charged to the Customer Group based on the contract. In 2019, inter-party discussions were held based on 
the contract terms with the Customer Group, and in March and October 2020 in accordance with the contract 
terms as the next step, the IHI Group had sincerely held discussions through mediation including third party. 
However, since no agreement was reached, the IHI Group determined that the discussions had reached a 
stage where there was no option left but to refer the dispute resolution to the court proceedings in the local 
court based on the contract terms. As a result, on December 4, 2020, the IHI Group filed a lawsuit with the 
local court seeking to have the Customer Group pay approximately 227 million U.S. dollars as a claim for a 
higher contracted amount primarily on the grounds of breach of contract. Meanwhile, on December 4, 2019, 
at the stage of aforementioned inter-party discussion, IHI E&C received a letter of claim for payment of 117 
million U.S. (hereinafter, the “Invoice amount”). dollars from the Customer Group for liquidated damages 
contractually stipulated in the case of delayed delivery. So far, because it had been difficult to reasonably 
estimate the amount of the effect on the financial position and operating results, the effect of the matter of the 
Invoice amount had not been reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
Meanwhile, IHI E&C and the Customer Group had been negotiating a settlement in parallel with the lawsuit. 
In those negotiations, IHI E&C reached a settlement under which it would receive settlement payments of 37 
million U.S from the Customer Group on October 13, 2023, and the IHI Group has recorded this impact in 
the second quarter ended September 30, 2023. As a result of the settlement, due to a partial shortfall in the 
recovery of costs incurred for reasons attributable to the Customer Group, a decrease in revenue was 
recorded in the second quarter ended September 30, 2023.
(*1) The process plant has been delivered to a customer, and commercial operation of LNG shipping equipment has started by 
the customer on August 26, 2020.

The aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations is as follows:
As of March 31, 2023
As of March 31, 2024
The amounts presented above include all consideration from contracts with customers.
The Vehicular turbochargers Business and the Rotating machineries Business in Industrial Systems and 
General-Purpose Machinery and the Civil aero engines Business in Aero Engine, Space and Defense belong 
to the volume production business, and their performance obligations are generally expected to be satisfied 
within one year.
Businesses other than above primarily belong to the individual made-to-order products business. As such, 
many of transactions in such businesses are for construction contracts that have performance obligations to 
be fulfilled over the span of one year or longer.
(4)    Assets recognized from contract costs
The IHI Group recognizes assets only to the extent that it is probable that the incremental commission fees 
paid to intermediaries mainly to obtain contracts and direct costs incurred for fulfilling contracts are 
recoverable.
Further, applying the practical expedient in Paragraph 94 of IFRS 15, the IHI Group recognizes the 
incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of such costs 
is one year or less.
The amounts capitalized as of March 31, 2023 and 2024 are immaterial.

(2)    Performance-based share remuneration plan
A.  Description of the plan
IHI adopted a performance-based share remuneration plan (hereinafter, the “Plan” in this section) in 
order to enhance the motivation of directors and executive officers (hereinafter, “Directors, etc.” in this 
section) to contribute to increasing corporate value of the IHI Group over the medium- to long-term by 
making a strong link between the remuneration for Directors, etc. and price of ordinary shares of IHI 
(hereinafter, the “IHI’s shares” in this section) and medium- to long-term performance. The Plan is a 
system by which Directors, etc. will have IHI’s shares and money equivalent to market value of IHI’s 
shares (hereinafter, collectively with IHI’s shares, the “IHI’s shares, etc.” in this section) transferred to 
them through a trust set up by IHI (hereinafter, the “Trust” in this section). The Plan is outlined as 
follows:
a.  Acquisition of IHI’s shares by the Trust
The Trust will acquire IHI’s shares with money contributed by IHI as funds to transfer IHI’s shares, 
etc. to Directors, etc.
b.  Awarding of points to Directors, etc.
IHI will award Directors, etc. points, which will become the base for transferring IHI’s shares, etc. in 
accordance with the rules for transfer of shares prescribed by IHI.

c.  Adjustment of points
After the end of the three consecutive fiscal years of which the initial fiscal year will be the year when 
points will be awarded, such awarded points will be adjusted based on the degree of achievement of 
performance indicators (consolidated ROIC (return on invested capital)) predetermined by the Board 
of Directors of IHI.
d.  Transfer of IHI’s shares, etc. to Directors, etc.
The Trust will transfer IHI’s shares, etc. equivalent to the number of such adjusted points to Directors, 
etc. (including those who were eligible for receiving points as stated in above b. but who retired from 
IHI in subsequent years).
The transfer of IHI’s shares based on the Plan is categorized as equity-settled share-based payment 
whereas the transfer of money equivalent to market value of IHI’s shares is categorized as cash-settled 
share-based payment.
B.  Share-based payments transferred in the form of IHI’s shares
The number of points awarded and weighted-average fair value of equity-settled share-based payments 
transferred in the form of IHI’s shares under the Plan at the grant date are as follows:
Note:    Due to the fact that the fair value of points awarded is approximately the same as the stock price at the grant date, the stock 
price at the grant date has been used.
C.  Share-based payments transferred in the form of money equivalent to market value of the IHI’s shares
The carrying amounts of liabilities arising from the cash-settled share-based payments transferred in the 
form of money equivalent to market value of the IHI’s shares under the Plan are as follows:
D.  Share-based remuneration expenses
The amounts recorded as share-based remuneration expenses included in “Selling, general and 
administrative expenses” in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the fiscal years ended March 
31, 2023 and 2024 are ¥19 million and ¥9 million, respectively.

(1)    Capital management
The IHI Group manages its capital with the aim of maximizing corporate value through sustainable growth.
Indicators mainly used by the IHI Group for capital management are D/E ratio, ratio of equity attributable to 
owners of the parent and return on invested capital (ROIC).
The IHI Group’s D/E ratio, ratio of equity attributable to owners of the parent and ROIC are as follows:
These indicators are regularly reported to and monitored by management.
Further, the IHI Group’s borrowings include syndicated loans with associated financial covenants relating to 
the equity and profits, however there are no events which conflict with the covenants as of March 31, 2023 
and 2024.
(2)    Financial risk management
The IHI Group is exposed to financial risks (credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign exchange risk, interest rate 
risk, market price fluctuation risk) in the course of performing operation activities. To mitigate such financial 
risks, the IHI Group has managed the risks in accordance with certain policies.
The IHI Group uses derivative transactions to hedge the fluctuation risks of foreign exchange rates or interest 
rates under the policy of not entering into any speculative transactions.
(3)    Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk of a financial loss that the IHI Group will incur from a default of a contractual 
obligation by a counterparty of financial assets held by the IHI Group.
To manage the credit risks, pursuant to the internal regulations related to receivable management, the 
department of the IHI Group in charge of collections in each business department periodically monitors the 
condition of major customers, manages the collectability and balances by customer or by project ordered, 
and thus seeks for preservation of receivables by means of such as a collection of collateral and an early 
identification and mitigation of collectability concern caused by deterioration in financial status.
In derivative transactions, the IHI Group enters into contracts only with financial institutions with high 
ratings to reduce the counterparty risks.
The maximum exposure to the credit risk of the IHI Group’s financial assets is the carrying amount of the 
financial assets presented in the consolidated financial statements.
With respect to debt guarantees, the balance of debt guarantee presented in Note “40. Contingent liabilities” 
is the maximum exposure to the credit risks of the IHI Group’s debt guarantees.
The IHI Group does not hold any properties as collateral and other credit enhancements against these 
exposures to the credit risk.

The IHI Group determines allowance for doubtful accounts by classifying receivables into trade receivables 
and contract assets and other receivables.
Any receivable of which collection is fully or partially impossible or is considered extremely difficult is 
deemed as a defaulted receivable.
In addition, the IHI Group determines that the credit impairment has occurred when a payment delay is not 
due to a temporary demand for funds but due to significant financial difficulty of the debtor or other factors 
and the recoverability of the receivables is significantly doubtful.

(4)    Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is a risk that the IHI Group is unable to perform payments on the due date when it should 
perform the repayment obligation of financial liabilities as they become due.
The IHI Group prepares the appropriate funds for repayment by procuring short-term funds through 
measures, such as bank borrowings and commercial papers, and long-term funds through measures, such as 
long-term borrowings and bonds payables, if needed, in addition to net cash provided by operating activities.
Also, the IHI Group is taking efforts to secure liquidity and improve capital efficiency by means of financing 
through the cash management system among IHI and domestic subsidiaries, and among foreign affiliates in a 
partial area.
In addition, the IHI Group manages liquidity risks by measures such as timely forming and updating the cash 
flow plan by each group company.
The balanced of financial liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) by due date are as follows:

(5)    Foreign exchange risk management
To manage the foreign exchange risks for trade receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, 
the IHI Group hedges the foreign exchange risks monthly identified by currency by utilizing forward foreign 
exchange contracts and foreign currency options. Hedge results are reported to the executive in charge of the 
Finance & Accounting Division on a monthly basis. The IHI Group also carries out similar management for 
principal consolidated subsidiaries.
To reduce the fluctuation risk of foreign exchange rates of borrowings denominated in foreign currencies, 
IHI and certain consolidated subsidiaries use foreign currency swaps.
As for derivatives, transactions are recorded and the balance is confirmed between the IHI Group and the 
counterparty. Moreover, derivative balances and valuation gains or losses as of the month-end are reported to 
the executive in charge of the Finance & Accounting Division on a monthly basis.
Exposures to foreign exchange risk
Major exposures to foreign exchange risk of IHI and its consolidated subsidiaries (net) are as follows.
The amounts of exposures to fluctuation risk of foreign exchange rates is hedged by derivative transactions 
are excluded.
Foreign exchange sensitivity analysis
In each reporting period, the effect of a 1% appreciation of the Japanese yen against U.S. dollar on 
profit(loss) before tax in the consolidated statement of profit or loss is as follows.
However, this analysis is based on the assumption that other variable factors (such as balances and interest 
rates) are constant.

To reduce the fluctuation risks of interest rates regarding bonds payable and long-term borrowings, IHI and 
certain consolidated subsidiaries use interest rate swaps.
As for derivatives, transactions are recorded and the balance is checked up between the IHI Group and the 
contract partner. Moreover, derivative balances and valuation gains or losses as of the month-end are 
reported to the executive in charge of the Finance & Accounting Division on a monthly basis.
Exposures to interest rate risk
Exposures to interest rate risk of IHI and its consolidated subsidiaries are as follows.
The amount of exposures of which interest rate risk is hedged by derivative transactions are excluded.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
In each reporting period, the effect of a 1% increase in interest rate on profit before tax in the consolidated 
statement of profit(loss) or loss is as follows.
However, this analysis is based on the assumption that other variable factors (such as balances and foreign 
exchange rates) are constant.
(7)    Market price fluctuation risk management
IHI and certain consolidated subsidiaries hold shares associated with business consolidation or capital 
consolidation with companies to maintain business relationships, and such shares are exposed to the market 
price fluctuation risk.
As for such shares, their market prices and the financial condition of issuers (companies with which the IHI 
Group does business) are periodically monitored. Also, the IHI Group’s holding status of those securities is 
continuously reviewed by taking into account the relationships with the companies with which the IHI Group 
does business.
Exposures to market price fluctuation risk
Exposures to the market price fluctuation risk of IHI and its consolidated subsidiaries are as follows:
Stock price sensitivity analysis
In each reporting period, the effect of a 10% decrease in the market price of equity instruments held by the 
IHI Group on other comprehensive income (before tax effect) in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income is as follows.
However, this analysis is based on the assumption that other variable factors are constant.
- 187 -
(8)    Hedging activities
Forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are utilized to hedge cash flow fluctuation risk 
associated with changes in foreign exchange rates in transactions denominated in foreign currencies and 
changes in interest rates of borrowings, and are designated as cash flow hedges.
Derivative transactions are utilized to mitigate risks associated with future fluctuation of foreign exchange 
rates (market price fluctuation risk) to which the IHI Group is exposed when performing its ordinary 
business activities, and are not utilized to gain short-term trading profits or for speculative purposes.
Notes and accounts receivable - trade, which are trade receivables, are exposed to customers’ credit risks. 
Trade receivables denominated in foreign currencies related to construction in abroad or the like are exposed 
to the fluctuation risks of foreign exchange rates, which are, in principle, hedged by derivatives using 
forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options for the position after netting trade payables 
denominated in foreign currencies.
Notes and accounts payable - trade, which are trade payables, are mostly settled within one year. Some of 
them are related to goods procured from overseas and denominated in foreign currencies, therefore they are 
exposed to the fluctuation risks of foreign exchanges. However, the amount is in general less than the 
balance of accounts receivable - trade denominated in the same foreign currency.
Derivatives that the IHI Group uses are forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the fluctuation risks of 
foreign exchanges pertaining to trade receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, and 
interest rate swaps to hedge the fluctuation risks of interest rates regarding borrowings.
For details of hedge accounting, such as hedging instruments and hedged items, hedging policy and method 
for assessing hedge effectiveness, refer to “C. Derivatives and hedge accounting” of Note “3. Material 
accounting policies, (4) Financial instruments.”

(9)    Fair value of financial instruments
The fair value measurements of financial instruments measured at fair value are categorized into the 
following three levels based on the observability and significance of inputs used to measure such financial 
instruments.
Level 1:       Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets
Level 2:       Fair value, other than Level 1, that is determined by directly or indirectly using the observable 
price
Level 3:       Fair value determined by using valuation techniques that incorporate unobservable inputs
A.   Measurement method for fair value
The measurement method for fair value of financial instruments is as follows.
(Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables)
As the fair value of these accounts is assumed to be approximate to their carrying amount due to the 
short-term maturity, no further information is given.
(Bonds and borrowings)
The fair value of bonds is determined based on the market prices or prices provided by financial and 
other institutions with which the IHI Group does business.

The fair value of borrowings is determined based on the present value of future cash flows discounted at 
the interest rate to be applied if similar new contracts were entered into.
These liabilities are classified as Level 2.
(Government grants classified under contingent settlement provisions)
The fair value of government grants classified under contingent settlement provisions is determined 
based on the present value of future cash flows discounted at the interest rate to be applied if similar new 
contracts were entered into.
These liabilities are classified as Level 2.
(Other financial assets and other financial liabilities)
Derivatives are measured as financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss 
based on prices provided by the counterparty financial institutions and classified as Level 2.
The fair value of marketable shares and investments in capital are calculated based on the market price 
at the account closing date and classified as Level 1.
The fair value of non-marketable shares and investments in capital are calculated by the valuation 
technique using the net asset value, the valuation technique using quoted market prices of comparable 
companies, and in both cases, they are classified as Level 3.
B.   Financial instruments measured at amortized cost
The carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments measured at amortized cost are as follows.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of IHI Corporation and its subsidiaries (the 
Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at March 31, 2024, and the consolidated 
statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and notes 
to the consolidated financial statements.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the 
consolidated financial position of the Group as at March 31, 2024, and its consolidated financial performance and 
its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs).
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical 
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in Japan, and we have fulfilled 
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of the audit of 
the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming the auditor’s opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters.

With an increase in the number of shop visits over the next few 
years, and an average of 350 aircraft expected to be grounded 
between 2024 and 2026, the Company, which holds 
approximately 15% share in the aforementioned engine program, 
expects to incur costs related to such as compensation and 
additional maintenance. The reason for the increase in the 
number of shop visits is that at Pratt & Whitney (“P&W”), a 
partner company in the PW1100G-JM engines program, it was 
discovered that there were quality issues rarely in the 
manufacturing process of powder metallurgy parts manufactured 
in the past, and as a result of P&W’s technical review, a policy 
of repeat inspections and shortening the service life was issued 
for parts in question in September 2023. Approximately 3,000 
engines are affected, repeat inspections at certain cycle intervals 
and parts replacement are required. These result in an increase in 
the number of shop visits. The period from engine removal to 
installation is expected to be 250 to 300 days. Effective 
countermeasures have already been taken for the manufacturing 
process, and no similar issues have occurred with parts other 
than those currently known to be affected.
As described in Note 6. “Segment information” to the 
consolidated financial statements, revenue related to Aero 
Engine, Space and Defense was ¥270,402 million for the year 
ended March 31, 2024. And such revenue reduction represents 
58% of revenue related to Aero Engine, Space and Defense for 
the year ended March 31, 2024.
The expected total incurred costs related to compensation and 
additional maintenance in such engine program was estimated 
by considering the following key assumptions.
(a) The expected engine quantities in question
(b) The expected period from engine removal to installation
(c) The average of aircraft quantities expected to be grounded 
between 2024 and 2026
There is uncertainty in these assumptions, and it is dependent on 
management judgment. And any changes in these assumptions 
significantly impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Therefore, we determined that the estimates of refund liabilities 
due to additional inspection program for shipped PW1100G-JM 
engines in the Civil aero engine Business is a key audit matter.
・   We mainly performed the following audit procedures to
assess the action plan for these parts in question, to assess
to see if there is any problem except for these parts in
question,to assess the expected total incurred costs related
to compensation and additional maintenance recorded in
the second quarter ended September 30, 2023, and to
assess the reasonableness of above three key assumptions
(a) to (c).
(1) We discussed with management and made inquiries 
of the Planning & Control Department of Aero 
Engine, Space & Defense Business Area.
(2) We reviewed the relevant minutes of the Board of 
Directors.
(3) We examined the information provided by 
International Aero Engines LLC (“IAE”) who 
oversees this engine program.
(4) We confirmed the disclosure timing and content by 
RTX Corporation who is the parent company of 
P&W.
・   We mainly performed the following audit procedures to
assess the effectiveness of the estimation process of refund
liabilities the management assessed.
(1) We compared preliminary estimated amounts of 
refund liabilities with actual amounts, regarding the 
status of compensation to the customers and the 
additional maintenance implementation for the 
fiscal year ended March 31, 2024.
(2) We compared preliminary estimated amounts of 
refund liabilities for unconfirmed portion with 
revised estimated amounts, and examined the latest 
information provided by IAE for the fiscal year 
ended March 31, 2024.

Recoverability of deferred tax assets of IHI Corporation
Description of Key Audit Matter
Auditor’s Response
Deferred tax assets were ¥98,173 million and were 4.7% of total 
assets in the consolidated statement of financial position as at 
March 31, 2024. As described in Note 18. “Income taxes” to the 
consolidated financial statements, deferred tax assets before 
offsetting deferred tax liabilities were ¥166,228 million. Further 
IHI Corporation (the Company) and its wholly owned 
subsidiaries in Japan adopted the group tax sharing system for 
Japanese corporate tax and local corporate tax.
Deferred tax assets on the consolidated statement of financial 
position primarily represent those arising from the tax sharing 
group with the Company as the parent company and are mostly 
related to the Company’s own deferred tax assets related to 
deductible temporary differences and net operating loss 
carryforwards.
As described in Note 4. “Significant accounting judgements, 
estimates and assumptions” to the consolidated financial 
statements, the Group recognizes deferred tax assets to the 
extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences, etc. can be 
utilized. In determining the probability that taxable profit will be 
available, the Group estimates the timing and the amount of the 
taxable profit based on its business plan.
The Group has made estimates for taxable income for the fiscal 
year ending March 31, 2025, and subsequent fiscal years by 
considering the assumptions regarding additional inspection 
program for shipped PW1100G-JM engines in the Civil aero 
engines Business as well as the effects of various investments to 
realize transformation, measures for the expansion of the 
lifecycle businesses and the strengthening of earnings 
foundations set forth in the “Group Management Policies 2023”.
The assumptions regarding additional inspection program for 
shipped PW1100G-JM engines in the Civil aero engines 
Business are considered to be the most significant assumption in 
the above estimates. As described in Key Audit Matter “The 
estimates of refund liabilities due to additional inspection 
program for shipped PW1100G-JM engines in the Civil aero 
engine Business”, there is uncertainty in these assumptions, and 
it is dependent on management judgment.
Therefore, we determined that recoverability of deferred tax 
assets of the Company is a key audit matter.
We mainly performed the following audit procedures to verify 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets of the Company.
・   We examined the balance of temporary differences and net
operating loss carryforwards by involving tax specialists,
and we also examined scheduling of the timing of their
reversal to assess the reasonableness of the estimate of 
future taxable income.
・   We compared the estimate of future taxable income to the
underlying business plan approved by the Board of
Directors.
・   We compared the business plans for the current
consolidated fiscal year with the actual result to assess the
effectiveness of the estimation process of Management’s
business planning.
・   We mainly performed the following audit procedures to
assess the reasonableness of key assumptions adopted in
preparing the business plan.
・   We discussed with management and made inquiries of
the Planning & Control Department of Aero Engine, 
Space & Defense Business Area.
・   We performed the audit procedures as described in
Auditor’s Response of Key Audit Matter “The 
estimates of refund liabilities due to additional 
inspection programfor shipped PW1100G-JM engines 
in the Civil aero engine Business” to assess the key 
assumptions regarding additional inspection program 
for shipped PW1100G-JM engines in the Civil aero 
engines Business.
・   We examined management’s assessment of estimation
uncertainties that are reflected as certain risks in the 
future business plan by performing trend analysis from 
past results.
・   We independently estimated future taxable income by
incorporating the effect of specific uncertainties into the
business plan, considering the results of the above 
procedures and examined the impact to the judgment on the 
recoverability of deferred tax assets the Company assessed.

Responsibilities of Management, the Audit & Supervisory Board Members and the Audit & Supervisory 
Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with IFRSs, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the 
preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error.

continue as a going concern and disclosing, as required by IFRSs, matters related to going concern.
The Audit & Supervisory Board Members and the Audit & Supervisory Board are responsible for overseeing the 
Group’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our 
opinion. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise professional 
judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
・ Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to
　fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is
　sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
・ Consider internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
　circumstances for our risk assessments, while the purpose of the audit of the consolidated financial statements is
　not expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
・ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
　related disclosures made by management.
・ Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
　the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast
　significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty
　exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated
　financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on
　the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may
　cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
・ Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the
　disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in
　a manner that achieves fair presentation in accordance with IFRSs.
・ Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business
　activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for
　the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit
　opinion.

1.  Basic framework of internal control related to financial reporting
Hiroshi Ide, Representative Director and President of IHI Corporation (“IHI”), has the responsibility for the design and operation of 
internal control over financial reporting of IHI and manages the design and operation of such internal control in accordance with the 
basic framework set forth in the document “On the Setting of the Standards and Practice Standards for Management Assessment and 
Audit concerning Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (Council Opinions)” published by the Business Accounting Council.
Internal control aims at achieving its objectives to a reasonable extent given that all individual components of internal control are 
integrated, and function as a whole. Thus, it is possible that internal control over financial reporting may not be able to completely 
prevent or detect false statements in financial reporting.
2.  Scope, date and procedures for evaluation
Assessment of internal control over financial reporting was performed as of March 31, 2024 (i.e., the closing date of the current 
fiscal year) in accordance with assessment standards for internal control over financial reporting generally accepted in Japan.
In this assessment, evaluation was first made of company-level control which would have a material impact on the reliability of 
financial reporting on a consolidated basis, and based on such result, business processes to be assessed were selected. In the business 
process-level control assessment, the effectiveness of internal control was assessed by analyzing the business processes in scope, 
identifying key controls that would have a material impact on the reliability of the financial reporting, and evaluating the designs and 
operations of these key controls.
The scope of internal control assessment over financial reporting was determined by selecting IHI, consolidated subsidiaries and 
affiliates accounted for using the equity method based on the materiality of their impacts on the reliability of financial reporting. The 
materiality of the impacts on the reliability of financial reporting was determined in consideration of both quantitative and 
qualitative aspects, and the scope of the business processes for which internal controls were to be assessed was determined rationally 
based on the outcome of company-level internal control assessment performed for IHI, 80 consolidated subsidiaries, and one 
affiliate accounted for using the equity method. 63 consolidated subsidiaries and 27 affiliates accounted for using the equity method 
were excluded from the scope of this company-level control assessment as their quantitative and qualitative impacts were deemed 
insignificant.
In determining the scope of business process-level control assessment, the ten business sites/offices where the accumulated revenue 
(after eliminating intra-group company transactions) for the previous fiscal year of each business site/office reached to roughly two-
thirds of the consolidated revenue in the previous fiscal year were determined to be the “Significant Businesses.” Moreover, for 
affiliates accounted for using the equity method, the scope of evaluation was determined by considering the materiality of effect on 
consolidated financial statements, and one business site/office was selected as a “Significant Business.” In such Significant 
Businesses, all business processes related to the accounts that are closely associated with IHI’s business objectives, such as revenue, 
accounts receivable, and inventory were included in the scope of assessment. Furthermore, regardless of the selected Significant 
Businesses, certain other important business processes with a high possibility of critical misstatements and which are related to 
significant accounting items involving estimates and forecasts, or related to businesses or operations dealing with high-risk 
transactions were added to the scope of assessment as business processes with material impacts on financial reporting.
3.  Result of evaluation
Based on the above mentioned assessment, it was concluded that the internal control over financial reporting at the end of the current 
fiscal year was effective.
4.  Supplementary information
There are no noteworthy matters that are pertinent to this Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting for the 
consolidated financial statements.
5.  Other information for special attention
There are no noteworthy matters that are pertinent to this Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting for the 
consolidated financial statements.
