During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the global economy has the U.S. economy remained firm, 
supported by solid employment and income environment even under the monetary tightening, while the 
European and Chinese economies remained stagnant despite signs of recovery in each.

recovering gradually, although it is still affected by global inflation.
In the IHI Group’s main business of Aero Engine, Space and Defense, in the Civil aero engines Business, sales 
of spare parts have increased due to remaining steady demand for aero transportation. In the Defense Business, 
under the government policy of fundamentally reinforcing Japan’s defense capabilities, the defense budget 
have greatly increased, and the IHI Group is currently working on large projects received in the previous fiscal 
year. In order to respond to the expected increase in demand for civil aero engines, defense-related business, 
and space-related business in the future, the IHI Group will continue to enhance its manufacturing capacity 
including securing resources and achieve the world’s highest level of production efficiency.
Regarding the additional inspection program for shipped PW1100G-JM engines, the IHI Group continue to 
work with its program partners to enhance maintenance capacity and reduce the number of aircraft grounded.

confidence.

secure high profitability that contributes to group earnings and to generate the investment capital.

Group submitted the interim report to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism on June 4 of 
this year. The investigation by the special investigation committee is ongoing, and the IHI Group will continue 
to investigate the cause of the issue and formulate necessary preventive measures. Following the occurrence of

discovered misconduct in a test to measure the maximum capacity of snowblower in the Transport systems 
Business. The IHI Group is currently investigating the facts and determining the cause of the issue, and will 
sincerely respond to the customers to whom the subject products delivered.

on-site inspection by the Japan Fair Trade Commission in September 2023, the IHI Group will promptly reflect 
such impact to the financial forecast.

from the previous corresponding period to ¥328.7 billion. Revenue increased 16.7% from the previous 
corresponding period to ¥348.1 billion due to an increase in sales of spare parts for civil aero engines, progress 
in a large-scale power plant project in Southeast Asia, and the effects of yen depreciation.
In terms of profit, operating profit increased ¥14.9 billion to ¥23.8 billion due to significant increasing revenue 
of Civil aero engines, despite a deterioration in profitability due to delay in progress of sales price negotiations 
for some projects in Vehicular turbochargers and an increase in SG&A expenses such as personnel costs. Profit 
before tax increased ¥18.9 billion to ¥31.6 billion due to increases in profit of investments accounted for using

(3) EXPLANATION REGARDING FUTURE PREDICTION INFORMATION SUCH AS 
CONSOLIDATED FORECASTS OF RESULTS
As the outlook for the global economy remains uncertain, it is necessary to continue to pay attention to the 
impact of global monetary tightening, stagnation in the real estate market in China, the rising tensions in the 
Middle East and Ukraine, and the U.S. presidential election. The Japanese economy is expected to continue 
gradual recovery as the employment and income environment improves.
The IHI Group is promoting initiatives based on “Group Management Policies 2023”, a three-year medium-
term management plan that begins in fiscal 2023. In order to respond to drastic changes in the business 
environment and to transform its business into one that achieves sustainable high growth, the IHI Group will 
boldly shift its management resources and invest to growth businesses in the aero engines and rocket fields, 
which are driving its growth, and to development businesses in the clean energy field, which is expected to 
become future business pillars.
In the aero engines and rockets fields as a growth business, global demand for aircraft is expected to grow 
steadily in the future. The IHI Group participates in the development and mass production of best-selling 
engines from the small to large and ultra-large engine classes for civil aero engines, and will respond to the 
growing demand for newly manufactured engines and aftermarket products. In addition, the IHI Group will 
strengthen its production capacity and develop necessary technologies, aiming to expand its defense and space-
related businesses, which are expected to grow.
In the clean energy field, which is its development-focus business, the IHI Group will contribute to the
realization of carbon neutrality by building its entire value chain for fuel ammonia, from production to storage,
transportation, and utilization, while applying its technical capabilities. During the three months ended June 30, 
2024, IHI was completed with good results for large-volume ammonia substitution demonstration testing 
(representing 20% of heating value) at Hekinan Thermal Power Station of JERA Co., Inc. IHI will continue to 
work on establishing a combustion technology that increases the ammonia ratio at thermal power plants and 
develop burners for 100% ammonia combustion.
In its core businesses of Resources, Energy and Environment, Social Infrastructure, and Industrial Systems and 
- 6 -
General-Purpose Machinery, the IHI Group will continue to create a continuous growth scenario through the 
transformation of its business portfolio and generate cash necessary for investments.
In order to achieve these, the IHI Group will develop and acquire the human resources necessary for change, 
advance the sophistication of our digital infrastructure, and promote the transformation of its corporate culture 
and structure.
With regard to the consolidated forecasts of results for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, the forecasts for 
both revenue and profit remain unchanged from the previous forecasts (May 8, 2024). Note that foreign 
exchange rate of ¥140/US$1 has been assumed in the above forecasts in and after the second quarter ending 
September 30, 2024.
Concerning dividends, no changes have been made to the previous forecasts.

(5) NOTES TO THE CONDENSED QUARTERLY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Material accounting policies applied by the IHI Group in the condensed quarterly consolidated financial statements 
are the same as those in the consolidated financial statements for the previous fiscal year.
Income taxes for the condensed quarterly consolidated financial statements are calculated based on the estimated 
annual effective tax rate.
The IHI Group has applied the standard IAS 7 “Statement of Cash Flows” (amended in May 2023) and IFRS 7 
“Financial Instruments: Disclosures” (amended in May 2023), (expanded disclosure of Supplier Finance 
Arrangements) effective for the first quarter ending June 30, 2024. The adoption of this standard does not have a 
material impact on the Group's condensed quarterly consolidated financial statements for the first quarter ending 
June 30, 2024.

1.   Overview of reportable segment
The business segments are constituent units of the IHI Group for which separate financial information is 
available. The Board of Directors periodically examines these segments for the purpose of deciding the 
allocation of management resources and evaluating operating performance.
The IHI Group organizes SBUs by products and services and allocates Business Areas to control these SBUs. 
Each Business Area manages and supervises the SBUs’ execution of business strategies, and allocates 
management resources necessary for execution of the SBUs’ business strategies. SBUs shall be the units 
possessing complete business processes including sales, developments, designs, productions, constructions, 
services, etc. based on the visions and strategies drawn up by Business Areas. Each SBU is an organization 
executing business and responsible for ensuring a profit in the SBU.
Based on the above, the IHI Group consists of segments by these Business Areas and sets the Business Areas 
of “Resources, Energy and Environment,” “Social Infrastructure,” “Industrial Systems and General-Purpose 
Machinery,” and “Aero Engine, Space and Defense” as its reportable segment. There are no aggregated 
business segments when deciding the reportable segment.
Main businesses, products and services belonging to each segment are as follows:
